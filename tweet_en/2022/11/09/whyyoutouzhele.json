It sounds like a lot, but it is not. You only need to stock up on the most basic rice, flour, salt and oil to ensure that you will not starve to death if you have no food for more than a month of lockdown.\nThis is your safety line\nOf course, if you have space at home, you can even buy a bean sprout machine, mushroom box and other things to prepare, and they are available on Taobao, which is very convenient.","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1590366573696798721","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2022-11-09 23:31:53","content":"As for fresh meat, eggs, milk and vegetables, you can't store them. They will go bad if you leave them alone, so you have to buy them now. And in order to ensure that you have enough food, you should try to buy food as much as possible during the lockdown. Prepare food for when necessary. Of course, there is one more thing, you must protect your food reserves and put them in a place where Dabai can't find them. Because it is very likely that you will be taken to quarantine, and your home will be cleared when you return, and all your previous preparations will be ruined. So you have to hide them well.","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1590368368036487168","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2022-11-09 23:39:01","content":"If you want to write about nucleic acid, you can’t just write about nucleic acid","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2022/11/09/1590368368036487168_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/mhIe0eet07","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1590369370647166978","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2022-11-09 23:43:00","content":"Um ","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2022/11/09/1590369370647166978_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/brCnnntWtV","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1590373587810398210","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2022-11-09 23:59:45","content":"Rumor-busting correction:\nA Weibo blogger released an eight-minute full video\nThe video shows that the real situation is that residents of the community gathered at the entrance of the community and demanded that all positive patients in the community be taken away.\nIt is not that Liu Hongying is positive.\nThis correction is hereby attached with the full video","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2022/11/09/1590373587810398210_0.jpg,/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2022/11/09/1590373587810398210_1.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/KRVmeiBOgw","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"}]
