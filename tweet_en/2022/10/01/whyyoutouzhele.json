As an educator, she certainly hopes that every female student she tries to save can change her fate and become a useful person to society, rather than just living a life without worries about food and clothing. To say that she looks down on that student is actually a practice of her own educational philosophy. But if put into a larger context, I also support that everyone can have their own choices.",

But in fact, there is no such profession as a full-time housewife in rural areas. Most women have to work to earn money to support their families. There are also many lazy men who rely on their wives for support and beat them. Therefore, the topic of anti-marriage may not be applicable to the discussion here.",
