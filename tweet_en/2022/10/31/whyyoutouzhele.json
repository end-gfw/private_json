You think he cares about you, but in fact he is using his care to continue to protect the Communist Party, that's all.\nIn fact, Hu Xijin has said more than once that he is fighting a war of public opinion. Everything he says is for the purpose of public opinion war.\nThat's why he often goes around in circles, sometimes black and sometimes white.\nThis job is destined to make him completely abandon any personal cognition",
