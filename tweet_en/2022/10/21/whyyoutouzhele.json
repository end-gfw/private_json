From a few years ago when there was an emergency, netizens actively tagged Jiangning Public Security Online to \"seek reversal\", to today when people no longer believe the so-called \"white text on a blue background\", how did the credibility of the Chinese government collapse step by step?",

    "content": "I think one of the important reasons is that in the past few years, when responding to emergencies, the government has been too eager to calm the incidents as quickly as possible and has ignored the truth. As a result, there have been too many incidents where the government's rumor-refuting was actually debunked, such as the frequent rumor-refuting prophecy during the epidemic and the god-level operation of five notices contradicting each other in the Iron Chain Girl incident. The government's perfunctory attitude is obvious, so that even if it is the truth, people are unwilling to believe it.",

She is not a junior high school student, but she has had four children with this man since she was in the second or thirteenth year of junior high school, and all four children were raised by the girl\n2. She was not raped in the park, but beaten. And domestic violence was frequent, and the girl committed suicide many times because of this.",
