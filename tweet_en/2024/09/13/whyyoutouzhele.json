Such families, no matter how much effort they put in, still have to rely on social security to provide a safety net in the end. As a result, in the past five years, in order to accurately target households and individuals for targeted poverty alleviation, almost all administrative and financial resources of counties, towns and villages have been occupied. Most of these resources have been wasted on infinitely complicated formalisms that should not be done to meet inspections and to conform to logic.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834260782743495111_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834260782743495111_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834260782743495111_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834260782743495111_3.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":false},{"id":"1834263034786971805","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-09-13 00:09:21","content":"Netizens reported that small cards for downloading anti-censorship software appeared on shared bicycles in Guangzhou.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834263034786971805_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834263034786971805_1.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1834263618411471100","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-09-13 00:11:40","content":"On the evening of September 12, multiple flights were delayed again at Tianjin Binhai Airport.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834263618411471100_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834263618411471100_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834263618411471100_2.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1834265757175161229","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-09-13 00:20:10","content":"Currently, searches related to \"Cambodia Canal\" have been blocked on TikTok, Baidu, and 360.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834265757175161229_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834265757175161229_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/09/13/1834265757175161229_2.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1834314139260649951","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-09-13 03:32:25","content":"In the early morning of September 12, the leaders of the Zhujiang Branch of Tianjin University of Finance and Economics led more than 40 social personnel to emptied the supermarket on campus.\nAccording to the person in charge of the supermarket, they have been operating this supermarket for 16 years.
