    "content": "According to Russian media reports, in the Kursk region, a North Korean soldier shot and killed three Russian soldiers due to language problems during the retreat. The soldier has been detained.\nAccording to reports, 50 North Korean soldiers were sent to attack Ukrainian positions, with a supervision team behind them to prevent them from escaping and cowardly fighting. When the North Korean soldiers charged, they were attacked by Ukrainian artillery and drones, resulting in heavy casualties. So some soldiers began to retreat, but were stopped by the Russian army and questioned about the reason for their escape. Due to the language barrier, the two sides failed to communicate, so a North Korean soldier shot at the Russian army and shot and killed three Russian soldiers. The North Korean soldier who fired the gun has been detained, but there is basically no way to punish him except to send him to the next charge again.",
