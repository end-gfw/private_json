He suspected that the foundation had settled unevenly. The owner hoped to protect his rights through litigation and judicial appraisal. As soon as the lawsuit was filed, the property management closed the basement and sent more than 30 security guards to force repairs and destroy evidence. The police also sided with the developer, saying that the developer had a red-headed document and that if the owner obstructed the developer's construction, the police would take compulsory measures.",
