The complexity of human nature and society is far from being summarized by a grand narrative like the proletariat. In particular, academic work must be rigorous and logical, and not make big and broad empty words.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/23/1870862614903050349_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/23/1870862614903050349_1.jpg,","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/23/1870862614903050349_0.jpg,","isReply":false,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":252,"replies":46,"retweets":28,"views":37167,"originVideos":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1870861112302018560/pu/vid/avc1/720x1280/quFqQTXXpyKpafRW.mp4?tag=12,","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1870870071888982382","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-23 00:32:38","content":"December 21, Wenling, Zhejiang.
