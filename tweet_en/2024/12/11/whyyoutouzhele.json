The monthly rent of an electric car is as high as 799, divided into 12 installments, and the contract stipulates that the minimum rent is three months, and there is a sky-high overdue fee of 35 yuan a day. Many of the victims are poor college students. Some students were injured while delivering food and could not afford to go to the hospital because insurance only reimbursed 30%.\nThe victims tried to call the police to report that the Zhangzhou Huiyin Leasing Co., Ltd. involved in the incident was suspected of fraud, but the police did not care. Some employees in the company could not stand it and leaked the company's list of defaulters. In the first batch alone, more than 700 victims were sued by the company. If they did not want to be sued, they would need to pay the company 13,800 yuan for the settlement privately. The total amount of more than 700 victims was at least tens of millions.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/11/1866633372728184983_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/11/1866633372728184983_1.jpg,","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/11/1866633372728184983_0.jpg,/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/11/1866633372728184983_1.jpg,","isReply":false,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":250,"replies":94,"retweets":35,"views":52567,"originVideos":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1866632113996566531/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/LEaqHx0rSACSrC8-.mp4?tag=12,https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1866632126642462720/pu/vid/avc1/720x1280/NeJm43OZ5tHx9hHM.mp4?tag=12,","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1866634989221360115","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-11 08:03:56","content":"It is reported that similar routines were exposed by a local TV program in August this year.
