The drill bit hit the explosive left behind, causing an explosion, which caused a man to remove his left eyeball and blurred vision in his right eye. The injured believed that this was a work-related injury, but the mine owner not only failed to provide reasonable compensation and treatment, but also tried to shirk responsibility and blamed the accident on the injured. The injured then petitioned and was detained for five days, and was accused of \"stealing national resources\". The injured felt very wronged and helpless about this accusation. He said that he came here through an introduction and worked for only 5 days. He knew nothing about the operation and management of the gold mine and did not gain any vested interests. He questioned: \"Is my eye blinded by the explosion, and justice has also abandoned me?\"",
