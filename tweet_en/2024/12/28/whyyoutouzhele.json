Some sheep were even starved to death.\nOn December 6, a plucked goat was thin but had a bulging belly at a slaughterhouse in Xixiangtang District, Nanning City, Guangxi. The butcher used a knife to gently cut a hole in the sheep's belly, and the stomach of the sheep immediately gushed out of the sheep's belly and spread on the ground. Another knife cut the sheep's stomach, and green grass mixed with corn kernels immediately gushed out.\n\"There are about 10 kilograms of grass and fodder, all of which are fed in to increase weight.\" The butcher said that this is still a relatively small amount. On the same day, a sheep was fed 20 to 30 kilograms and died of suffocation...\nThe reporter found through undercover investigation that these goats purchased and transported from Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou and other places were almost all not inspected and quarantined.
