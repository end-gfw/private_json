The scammers claim that \"patients invest 50,000 yuan and benefit 10,000 yuan in two months.\" Some people have been defrauded of millions of life-saving money.\nStarting from the first half of 2023, Huang began to organize \"matching donations\" among patients in the name of the foundation. The so-called \"matching donation\" is more like an investment scam. The common practice is to let patients invest 50,000 yuan and earn 10,000 yuan in two months. Because Huang herself is a patient, many patients trust her very much. The money invested by patients was deposited into different accounts designated by Huang, and the so-called benefits were transferred between patients, and Huang himself did not pay the benefits. This model is almost \"empty-handed white wolf\"\nStarting from October 2024, the principal and interest of patients have not come out one after another. So, patients asked Huang for money one after another. It was not until the end that everyone knew that Huang was just a part of the scam. Her identity is similar to the \"regional director\" in Hebei. Huang's superior is a man from Northeast China, Meng...",
