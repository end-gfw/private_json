The studio has produced many best-selling comics and was commissioned to draw the comic version of Douluo Continent.\nBut there is an unknown side behind the big studio that is loved by comic fans. Since the studio moved into a farm, the artists have been forced to live with hundreds of animals, work up to 16 hours a day, and listen to \"positive\" music while working. The studio also encourages employees to report each other. Unknowingly, the artists have become one of the many animals in the farm, and have become captive animals...\nMany artists who left the farm have lost their ability to speak, schizophrenia, and some even end their lives by lying on the road.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778533276684799_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778533276684799_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778533276684799_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778533276684799_3.jpg,","videos":"","isReply":false,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":136,"replies":16,"retweets":9,"views":32478,"originVideos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1869778668186370394","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-20 00:15:47","content":"Part II:","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778668186370394_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778668186370394_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778668186370394_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869778668186370394_3.jpg,","videos":"","isReply":true,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":13,"replies":2,"retweets":0,"views":5353,"originVideos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":false},{"id":"1869779606158586127","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-20 00:19:31","content":"Part III:","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779606158586127_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779606158586127_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779606158586127_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779606158586127_3.jpg,","videos":"","isReply":true,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":15,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"views":3384,"originVideos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":false},{"id":"1869779733673849268","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-20 00:20:01","content":"Part 4:","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779733673849268_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779733673849268_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779733673849268_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779733673849268_3.jpg,","videos":"","isReply":true,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":16,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"views":3235,"originVideos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":false},{"id":"1869779895133540465","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-20 00:20:40","content":"Part V:","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779895133540465_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779895133540465_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779895133540465_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869779895133540465_3.jpg,","videos":"","isReply":true,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":33,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"views":19188,"originVideos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":false},{"id":"1869780018450309251","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-20 00:21:09","content":"Part VI:","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869780018450309251_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869780018450309251_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/12/20/1869780018450309251_2.jpg,","videos":"","isReply":true,"isRetweet":false,"isSelfThread":false,"likes":34,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"views":18161,"originVideos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":false},{"id":"1869784140050214982","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-12-20 00:37:32","content":"The author \"Yuan Shang Bai Yun Jian\" was arrested by the authorities for writing a BL novel and uploading it to the Haitang Literature website.\nOn December 17, the husband of \"Yuan Shang Bai Yun Jian\" posted on Weibo that he saw his wife in a haggard state during the court hearing in November and was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison by the court.
