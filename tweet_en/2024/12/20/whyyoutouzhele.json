    "content": "Since September, many artists have accused A-soul Comics Studio of long-term exploitation of employees. The studio has produced many best-selling comics and was commissioned to draw the comic version of Douluo Continent.\nBut there is an unknown side behind the big studio that is loved by comic fans. Since the studio moved into a farm, the artists have been forced to live with hundreds of animals, work up to 16 hours a day, and listen to \"positive\" music while working. The studio also encourages employees to report each other. Unknowingly, the artists have become one of the many animals in the farm, and have become captive animals...\nMany artists who left the farm have lost their ability to speak, schizophrenia, and some even end their lives by lying on the road.",
