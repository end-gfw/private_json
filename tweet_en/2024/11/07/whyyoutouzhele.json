Zhou Fengsuo, Executive Director of Chinese Human Rights @hrichina @zhoufengsuo, was invited to give a keynote speech:\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nToday, I stand here with deep gratitude and a sense of mission, in this place that symbolizes resilience and hope, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. First of all, I would like to sincerely thank Andrzej of the Axel Springer Freedom Foundation, whose dedication and foresight made this exhibition possible. I would also like to thank Cornella Sebelt for agreeing to hold this exhibition in front of this historic building.\nHere, we are fortunate to see the Statue of Democracy. The statue was originally erected by the brave students in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Although it was destroyed by tanks in Beijing, it still stands and has become...","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/11/07/1854534910532325438_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/11/07/1854534910532325438_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/11/07/1854534910532325438_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/11/07/1854534910532325438_3.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":false,"fullContent":"11月7日，为纪念柏林墙倒塌35周年，“六四”民主女神像竖立在了柏林市议会门前。柏林各界和当年东德抗争者参加，中国人权@hrichina 执行主任周锋锁@zhoufengsuo 应邀作主题发言：\n女士们,先生们:\n今天，我怀着深深的感激和使命感站在这里，在这象征坚韧与希望的地方，纪念柏林墙倒塌35周 年。首先，我要衷心感谢阿克塞尔·斯普林格自由基金会的安杰，是她的奉献和远⻅卓识促成了这 个展览。我还要感谢科内拉·塞⻉尔德同意在这座历史悠久的大楼前举办这个展览。\n在这里，我们有幸⻅到⺠主女神像的⻛采。这座雕像最初由1989年天安⻔广场上勇敢的学生们树 立。尽管它在北京被坦克摧毁，但它依然屹立，成为自由与⺠主的普世象征。\n柏林墙不仅仅是一道物理屏障，更是意识形态压迫的化身，它分裂了家庭、朋友和社区。自1961 年建成以来，它就成为冷战的鲜明象征，将东方与⻄方、专制与⺠主分隔开来。1989年11月，它 的倒塌象征着和平革命，不仅实现了德国的重新统一，也标志着⺠主理念在全球战胜了专制政 权。\n当我听说柏林墙倒塌的消息时，我正与其他天安⻔抗议活动的学生领袖一起被关押在北京的一座\n高度戒备的监狱里。起初，我们都不明白发生了什么，因为中国的新闻没有准确、客观地报道柏\n林墙的倒塌。当我们了解事情的原委后，监狱的牢房里回响着我们的欢呼声。\n这是我一生中最自豪的时刻之一——它像一座希望的灯塔，表明专制政权可以被公⺠推翻。它表 明对自由的普遍渴望不会被高墙或枷锁所湮灭。\n重获自由多年后，在参观柏林史塔⻄博物馆时，看到莱比锡抗议者举着写有中文“⺠主”的旗帜,我感动 得热泪盈眶。目睹德国公⺠援引我们在天安⻔广场使用的同样理想甚至同样语言，这份感动难以 言表。它表明了我们斗争之间的深刻联系。对自由的追求超越了国界、文化和语言。\n今天，我们还必须向天安⻔大屠杀的受害者致敬，他们面对残酷镇压的勇气镌刻在我们的集体记\n忆中。坦克人面对从天安⻔广场驶出的一列坦克毫不畏惧地站立，已成为反抗暴政的全球象征。\n这证明了个人勇气在对抗不公中的力量。\n1989年，东德面临着与中国类似的国内动荡。然而，与北京的暴力镇压不同,东德选择了一条不同 的道路。人们对”中国式解决方案”——残酷的军事镇压——的恐惧显而易⻅。然而,普通德国人谴 责这种暴力，要求”不要重蹈中国覆辙”。最终，东德的和平抗议促成了柏林墙的倒塌。\n今天，我们面临新的挑战。中国共产党不仅在国内力量强大，在全球舞台上也日益崛起。专制主 义已经演变，通过技术手段延伸到新的领域。中国的”防火墙”屏蔽了信息自由流通,将中国公⺠与 ⺠主理念隔绝，压制异议声音。监控技术监视着公⺠的一举一动，创造了一个数字全景监狱，窒 息了言论自由。\n与局限于特定地理位置的物理屏障柏林墙不同，这道数字屏障超越了时间和空间。它代表了信息\n和思想的全新战场。中共利用技术进行监控和控制，开创了一个令人不安的先例，启发其他专制\n政权采用类似策略。\n 此外，中共正在全球范围内扩大影响力，与包括俄罗斯、伊朗和朝鲜在内的其他专制政府结盟。 这个联盟试图通过虚假信息宣传、网络战和经济胁迫，推动威权主义价值观，破坏⺠主制度,削弱 全世界对⺠主的信念。战线不再画在实体地图上，而是在人们的内心与思想中进行。\n柏林墙倒塌的教训比以往任何时候都更具意义。它告诉我们,高墙——无论是实体的还是数字的 ——都无法无限期地压制人类对自由的渴望。它向我们展示了和平抗议和国际团结的力量。它提 醒我们，普通人的行动确实可以改变历史进程。\n我们必须坚守人类精神的信念，坚信自由终将战胜一切。我们有责任团结起来，反对专制主义的 蔓延。我们必须支持被压迫者,捍卫信息的自由流动，维护⺠主和人权的价值观。\n当我们站在⺠主女神像前，让我们铭记无数人为追求自由而作出的牺牲。让我们以延续他们的事\n业来纪念他们，在面对压迫时拒绝沉默，努力推倒那些企图分裂我们的新高墙。\n最后,我敦促在座的每一位记住，争取自由是一个共同的旅程。柏林墙的倒塌不仅是德国的胜利， 也是全人类的胜利。同样，今天反对专制主义的斗争并不局限于任何一个国家——这是一项需要 我们共同承诺的全球事业。\n通过团结我们的声音和行动，我们可以挑战专制主义的蔓延。让我们共同努力,建设一个⺠主繁 荣、人权受到尊重、每个人的尊严都得到维护的世界。\n谢谢大家!","hasPublished":true},{"id":"1854537663564722216","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-11-07 22:53:29","content":"November 7 (Release) Tengchong, Yunnan.
