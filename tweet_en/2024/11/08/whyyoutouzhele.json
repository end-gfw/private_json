The property management company collected electricity bills every month, with huge errors and frequent power outages. In addition, the property management company also tied the property management fees to the electricity bills, and often cut off the owners' water and electricity to achieve the purpose of forcibly collecting property management fees. The owners' desire to hire a new property management company was also obstructed at every level. The owners have been reporting the situation to the relevant departments for five years, but have always been perfunctory. It is reported that Tianhua Mansion and Four Seasons Flower City in the same city also have the same problem.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/11/08/1854571402709397525_0.jpg,/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/11/08/1854571402709397525_1.jpg,","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true}]
