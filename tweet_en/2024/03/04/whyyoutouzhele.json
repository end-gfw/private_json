    "fullContent": "3月2日，公众号“真实故事计划por”发布了一篇题为《被竞业困住的大厂前员工》讲述了几名拼多多前员工因离职被竞业协议索赔数十万的故事。揭露了拼多多利用竞业协议将员工牢牢控制的手段。\n 基层员工被竞业索赔后才得知被人跟拍\n 故事的第一位主人公林知心，二本毕业的她靠着比旁人更多的付出，走到了今天的位置，她于2022年7月入职拼多多，担任“多多买菜”采销专员，报道那天，HR拿着厚厚的材料让她签字，但并未告之签这些材料的用途。离职后，2023年10月在她24岁生日那天，接到了一通上海的电话，仲裁员告之她被竞业，要索赔28万元的消息。\n 2023年11月，仲裁当天，林知心并没有到场，而是将一切委托给律师，事后通过律师带回来的视频里，林知心才得知原来自己离职后被被人跟踪，跟踪者拍下了林知心进入新公司大门的瞬间。\n 极度压抑的工作环境，每个人都是一台高效运转的机器。\n 故事的第二位主人公，赵程宇在离职后更换了手机和电话号码，本以为万事大吉的他，还是被拼多多以违反竞业限制协议为由，索赔42万。让他感到不可思议的是，明明每天戴着口罩上班，还是被对方拍照取证。\n 赵程宇回忆，第一天报道时，公司极度压抑的办公环境让他记忆犹新，一层约800人的办公室，桌椅之间没有任何空隙，每个人都在无情的敲击键盘，中午吃完饭后，大家都趴在桌上睡觉。在职时。赵程宇谨小慎微，从不敢在公司电脑上讨论任何有关公司相关的话题，“你要知道，你的电脑随时被监控着，所有聊天记录都可能被扒到”他说。\n  2020年，赵程宇在和拼多多签订的合同里，除了注明基本薪资外，还每年额外给他价值25万的股权激励，但想要拿到这笔收益，前提是要工作满两年。在两年多超强度的工作量下，赵程宇靠着把股票熬到手的信念，一直坚持工作。直到身体健康出现问题后于2022年10月提出离职。但此前HR曾让他签署一份股权授予协议，当时他想翻看前面的文件，但HR则在一旁催促他。直到签完后赵程宇才发现，原本在劳动合同中作为劳动报酬的一部分发放的股权激励，一旦他离职后被竞业，这笔钱将作为竞业补偿款，原封不动地归还于拼多多。\n 离职需要签署竞业协议通知书，否则无法拿到离职证明。\n 入职多多买菜被竞业索赔的陈鑫回忆，他于2022年入职多多买菜，他没有发现签署的若干文件里，还夹杂着一份竞业协议，直到他离职后才意识到竞业协议的存在。\n 2022年6月初，陈鑫提出离职，但期间HR一会表示希望他能尽快走，一会又改口还得一个月，总之就是一直拖着。直到月底，HR告之他必须签完《竞业协议通知书》后才算走完离职程序。但事后他才得知根据劳动法，员工在书面提交离职申请后，一个月后即可解除劳动合同。不需要征得用人方同意。离职后，陈鑫每月可以拿到竞业补偿款3700元，但违反竞业协议后，却要赔偿公司43万元。\n 除此之外他还表示拼多多的工作时间为早上11点到晚上23点，周末休息一天，但还要处理工作。\n 文章的最后，林知心、赵程宇、陈鑫、这几位故事主人公选择用法律的武器来维护自己的权益，但无一例外他们都在一审中败诉。他们和另一位同样遭遇的王天明一起，把他们的遭遇写成文章发到网上，并收获了大量的流量。拼多多公关曾答应和解，但后来他们一行人得知原来公关只是想拖着他们。\n 赵程宇表示，他不在乎输赢，只想着在这在这场对峙中，自己究竟能走多远。",
