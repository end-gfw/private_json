They did not stop until the two students were sent to the ambulance. During the period, the chief instructor Zhang Mouming also asked everyone to wait for him, and he wanted to shoot a video.\nThis move aroused the anger of many students. The students said that Zhang Mouming, the chief instructor of military training, had filmed military training content many times and posted it on Douyin to gain traffic. He also ran an MCN company. They questioned that the corporal punishment and tossing tonight were just to toss students to shoot Douyin materials for their accounts.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133063350641025_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133063350641025_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133063350641025_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133063350641025_3.jpg","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1766133514540400953","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2024-03-09 00:06:57","content":"https://t.co/ZCY1nY2Bzc","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133514540400953_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133514540400953_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133514540400953_2.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":true},{"id":"1766133833076818135","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2024-03-09 00:08:13","content":"https://t.co/RrrgAHhsyh","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766133833076818135_0.jpg","hasPublished":true},{"id":"1766138488724836427","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2024-03-09 00:26:43","content":"On March 8, the Affiliated Middle School of Shenzhen University","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766138488724836427_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766138488724836427_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766138488724836427_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/03/09/1766138488724836427_3.jpg","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1766142609842430282","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2024-03-09 00:43:06","content":"\"A country within a country\"\nA Hebei netizen submitted an article saying that all the roads from Hebei to Beijing are currently blocked.
