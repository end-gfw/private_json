    "content": "According to reports, the reason why \"Fantasy Westward Journey\" can survive to this day is closely related to its own economic system. Players can sell in-game props and equipment in some ways for cash, and it is not uncommon for some equipment to be worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan. Many people make a living from games, and players also regard game props as part of their investment. However, recently, due to its own revenue pressure, NetEase has begun to \"let go\" of the game on a large scale under the pretext of cracking down on \"studios\", lowering the equipment production rate in the game and adding a large amount of direct purchase content, causing many players to suffer heavy losses, thus resulting in the scene in the article.",
