This kind of cultural tourism marketing focused on marketing male and female eroticism, which actually did not help the scenic area much. People who came for this kind of interaction did not have much time to see the beautiful scenery.\nThe commentary article caused dissatisfaction among many netizens. Netizens believed that Jimu News had commented on the incident of a girl wearing anime costumes and being stopped by security inspectors on the subway. Public management should not be too broad, but criticized the recent \"male and female Daji\" incident in Henan. Netizens accused Jimu News of double standards and deliberately provoking confrontation.\nSubsequently, a large number of dissatisfied netizens began to \"defeat magic with magic\". First, they questioned that the LOGO of \"Jimu News\" was suspected to be the Japanese flag. The name \"Jimu\" contained Japanese elements, and even \"Japan\" was \"Mo\" if the horizontal line of the word \"Mu\" was split to the side of the word \"Mu\". Moreover, netizens found that they could not find any news about \"nuclear waste water\" in Jimu News, which further confirmed the netizens' \"speculation\".\nAs of the time of writing, due to too many netizens flocking to the live broadcast room and comment section to \"catch spies\", Jimu News has closed the comment function of videos and live broadcasts, and the items in its product display window have also been removed from the shelves.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/01/19/1748373872745861300_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/01/19/1748373872745861300_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/01/19/1748373872745861300_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/01/19/1748373872745861300_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false},{"id":"1748374282286043232","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2024-01-19 23:58:06","content":"At present, Jimu News has been called \"Ji Ri\" News by netizens.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/01/19/1748374282286043232_0.jpg","hasPublished":false}]
