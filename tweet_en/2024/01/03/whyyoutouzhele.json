    "content": "On January 2, the media reported that an 11-year-old girl in Kaifeng, Henan was taken to a KTV by her classmates and a dropout teenager and was beaten, insulted, and raped by many people. The video of the insult to the girl was also posted online. \nOn December 15, Xiaohua (pseudonym), an 11-year-old girl in the sixth grade of Qixian Primary School, was taken to a KTV in the county by her classmates, several off-campus students, and dropout teenagers. She was beaten, insulted, and raped by many people. \nXiaohua's mother, Ms. Yang, said that on the afternoon of December 15, 2023, Xiaohua was called to a KTV room in the county by a female classmate who had transferred to another school. A total of 9 students and dropout teenagers, including 5 girls and 4 boys, stripped Xiaohua's clothes and ordered Xiaohua to kneel in front of them. Xiaohua was then beaten with belts and other items, and wine was poured on her head. A dropout also raped Xiaohua in public. \nMs. Yang later learned from the police. The sexual assaulter is over 14 years old but under 15 years old. He started sexually assaulting Xiaohua in October 2023, but threatened Xiaohua not to say anything, otherwise he would \"kill her whole family.\" Ms. Yang said that after the violence, these people also posted videos insulting Xiaohua on the Internet and snatched Xiaohua's mobile phone and sold it. \nAt present, the dropouts who sexually assaulted Xiaohua and other suspects have been taken coercive measures by the police. Xiaohua now often wakes up at night, crying and laughing, and can only be hospitalized for treatment and can no longer continue to go to school. Ms. Yang and her husband are now on the verge of mental collapse. In addition, according to Ms. Yang, the incident has happened for more than half a month, and no parents have come out so far. \nOn the afternoon of December 31, 2023, Captain Gao of the Criminal Police Brigade of Qi County Public Security Bureau said that the case would definitely be handled in accordance with the law. Because it involves minors, the details of the case are inconvenient to disclose.",

At that time, the harmless earthquake was likened to a signal that Japan was \"punished by God\", and the context provided space for such speech.",
