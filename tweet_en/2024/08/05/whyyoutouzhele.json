Although it was established when financial tea frequently collapsed, its returns have remained high, attracting a large number of tea merchants to pursue it. In two years, it quickly became a giant tea company in the tea market, involving tens of billions.\n\"Financial tea\" has a set of conventional methods: first, grandly launch a new brand and advocate its scarcity and market prospects. For example, manufacturers use luxurious store decoration, high-profile opening celebrations, high-end tasting activities, etc., on the one hand, to demonstrate the company's strong strength, and on the other hand, vigorously promote a certain tea with high collection and investment value, and put it into the market through momentum and limited supply.\n\nThen create the illusion of tea price increase.
