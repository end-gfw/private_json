Therefore, WADA's additional testing of the Chinese swimming team is actually to help Chinese athletes prove their innocence to everyone.\nThe focus of the whole thing is that the United States questioned WADA's shielding of China, but some public opinions on the Chinese Internet have obvious traces of \"helping Russia\" rather than \"helping China\". Many contents come from Russian media and Russian self-made false contents, pointing the finger at WADA and accusing WADA of attacking Chinese sports.\nHe said that Russians do hate WADA, but the relationship between China, Russia and WADA is two different things.
