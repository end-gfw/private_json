It tells the story of a 33-year-old single girl who graduated from a 211 university in Beijing and took the civil service exam many times. Even though she ranked first in the written exam, she was never admitted. In April this year, she came to Xi'an, Shaanxi from her hometown in a poor mountain village in Ningxia to find a job. She died in her rented house in early June. She was not found until about 20 days after her death... Before her death, the girl blocked all her relatives.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824847924871999902_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824847924871999902_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824847924871999902_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824847924871999902_3.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1824848095928320424","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-08-18 00:37:44","content":"https://t.co/v7UYq5uDnp","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824848095928320424_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824848095928320424_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824848095928320424_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/08/18/1824848095928320424_3.jpg,","videos":"","hasPublished":true},{"id":"1824896798172819504","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-08-18 03:51:16","content":"[Warning] Tonight, several bloggers had their accounts hacked.
