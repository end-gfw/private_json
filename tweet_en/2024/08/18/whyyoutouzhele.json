    "content": "The article \"A girl from another province died in my rented apartment\" is breathtaking. It tells the story of a 33-year-old single girl who graduated from a 211 university in Beijing and took the civil service exam many times. Even though she ranked first in the written exam, she was never admitted. In April this year, she came to Xi'an, Shaanxi from her hometown in a poor mountain village in Ningxia to find a job. She died in her rented house in early June. She was not found until about 20 days after her death... Before her death, the girl blocked all her relatives.",

One part is to establish a Central Taiwan Working Committee as a \"shadow government\" to enter Taiwan at any time to take over the other side of the strait, and at the same time gather anti-Taiwan independence forces on the island.\nThe second part is to establish a Taiwan governance pilot zone to simulate the governance model after Taiwan's unification, so as to verify the policy effect and train the takeover cadres in advance.\nThe article was deleted and removed from the shelves soon after it was published, and was later saved by the US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and translated into English and posted on its own...",

    "fullContent": "8月5号，厦门大学海峡两岸城市规划研究所提出了一份接管台湾预案。\n文中提到，随着特朗普上台的可能性越来越大，统一台湾的时间表随时可能提前。\n由于台湾不存在“五十年不变”的问题，一旦大陆对台湾接管，其深度和广度要远远大过1997年的香港，做好统一以后全面接管台湾的预案已经迫在眉睫。\n该预案分为两部分，一部分是成立中央台湾工作委员会，作为“影子政府”随时入台接收对岸政权，同时凝聚岛内反台独力量。\n第二部分是建立台湾治理试验区，模拟台湾统一后的治理模式，以提前验证政策效果和培训接管干部。\n该文章发表之后很快被删除下架，后被美国智库战略与国际研究中心 (CSIS) 将其保存下来，并翻译成英文发布到自己的官网\n\n\n全文\n\n面对百年未有之大变局，国际形势瞬息万变。随着特朗普上台的可能性越来越大，统一台湾的时间表随时 可能提前。香港过去几年的动荡表明，政权移交如果没有充分做好预案，会对未来社会秩序的平稳移交带 来非常严重的后果。由于台湾不存在“五十年不变”的问题，一旦大陆对台湾接管，其深度和广度要远远 大过1997年的香港，做好统一以后全面接管台湾的预案已经迫在眉睫。\n\n为此，厦门大学海峡两岸城市规划研究所提出两项建议：\n\n第一，尽快成立中央台湾工作委员会。\n该机构的唯一目标，就是作为“影子政府”随时入台接收对岸政权。只有明确而急迫的目标，才能确保组织运转的效能。中央台湾工委组织架构完全对标对岸政权和核心组织，分为综合部门和专业部门。其中，综合部门重点研究政权接管后的法律适用、货币转换、陆岛基础设施对接、军公教甄别、海关及国际旅行等政策;专业部门的任务是彻底了解岛内对应部门的历史、现状、人员、运行规则等，并在此基础上提出多种接收预案，包括人员、经费、资产等。台湾作为一个相对与大陆更发达的经济体，所需要处理的很多问题都是大陆很少、甚至没有遇到的问题，这就需要这项工作越早开展越好。\n\n成立这一机构的作用：\n\n第一，尽快熟悉台湾目前的体制、制度、法律。有针对性地展开情报搜集，深度分析、了解、跟踪这些机构的现状和历史沿革。在借鉴日本殖民、国民党战后接受、香港回归等经验教训的基础上，提出相应的制度保留、制度改变、制度引入、制度新创，提前设计需要改变的制度，替代性的法律。和目前学术性的台湾研究不同，中央台湾工委各部门应该有具体而明确的任务导向，以实战为前提，才能深入、高效消化台湾现有的制度。\n\n第二，凝聚岛内反台独力量。近年来，岛内统一力量式微，缺乏统一的真实预期和实际的制度载体。随着国民党反台独立场的软化甚至走向隐性台独，支持统一的力量已经沦为无组织的个体行为。中央台湾工委的建立，可以将这部分力量整合到国家行为，反台独力量就会体系化、制度化，中共早期弱小时之所以能长期坚持，和当年共产国际的支持关系重大。中央台湾工委可以极大地改变岛内预期，让目前暂时被岛内丑化、孤立的反台独活动，成为祖国统一后的英雄行为。通过部门对口直接咨询、委托研究，征询岛内统一后的民意，可以将台湾回归的真实感传播到岛内各个阶层。此次“环台军演”之所以对台湾民心冲击不大，一个重要原因就是台湾民众认为统一还非常遥远。而只要开始实际政权接收准备，这个行动本身对岛内民心就会产生重大影响。\n\n第三，平滑政权转换冲击。随着大陆军力的增长，统一本身难度在下降，而统一之后的有效管制会变得越来越重要。中央台湾工委相关部门以个人咨询、项目委托等方式，让岛内精英和机构尽可能多地参与台湾接收方案的设计，就有可能对未来的政权转变冲击准备好更多的预案，岛内也会形成稳定的预期和心理准备。让台湾社会觉得政权交接方案是他们参与设计的，会极大地减少未来真实治理的成本，形成社会主流共识。\n\n第二，尽快建立台湾治理试验区。\n香港最近的动荡表明，一国两制，完全接受现有的制度的做法并不一定适合台湾，台湾一开始就要以彻底融入大陆为目标。为了提前试验政策的效果，培训接管政权的干部，有必要设置一个高度仿真的实体环境，全面模拟岛内统一后的管理模式。地点可以选在与金门接壤的厦门翔安区、泉州南安市。这里背山临海，有港口，有机场，语言文化与台湾相近，台湾的主要地理要素和基础设施都可以找到近似的对标。这是平潭所不具备的条件。特别是由于金厦来往密切，在此设实验区最有利于复制、模仿台湾现在的行政体制。\n\n第一，政策实验。在实验区内尽量模拟真实的台湾政权架构。政策和法律按照统一后台湾拟采用的实际政策，大到选举制度的存废，小到简体、繁体字的去留;远到货币如何过渡(包括土地在内的不动产制度的过渡)，近到教材、教师如何交接(包括高考制度和学历证)……然后让各个社会主体，特别是台湾本地人，对交接的方案提出修改建议，在试验区内实现政策快速迭代。\n\n第二，培训干部。设置台湾治理试验区的主要目的，就是模拟接管台湾后的真实治理模式，为实际接管储 备制度、培养人才。台湾脱离大陆多年，在大陆驾轻就熟的干部，在台湾可能要从“ABC”学起。无论是与 居民的互动模式，还是和媒体沟通的方法，都是大陆干部所不熟悉的。这就需要一个学习治理台湾的真实 场景。试验区可通过引进台湾退休的军公教人员，协助制定接管的政策细节，缩短政权切换这一风险最大 的过渡期。\n\n第三，执政示范。统一后台湾的治理样本原本是香港的“一国两制”。但之前的“捣乱”后，香港作为样板模式已经对岛内没有多少说服力。这就需要树立一个新的模范。解放战争共产党短期大规模接收国统区，看似摧枯拉朽，其实在此之前共产党已经在根据地有过大量政权建设的经验。现在我党虽然拥有政权治理的大量经验，但接收并建立政权的那一代人已经远去，这就需要我们重新开始。统一只是开始，治理才是检验统一是否成功的标准。",
