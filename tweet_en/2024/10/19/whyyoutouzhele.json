The blogger used the 9 yuan hourly wage of a roadside security guard to test his purchasing power in a supermarket. His goal was to buy rice, flour, oil, meat, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables. He found that he could not afford most fruits and vegetables, bagged rice, oil, etc. In the end, he bought a bag of milk, 0.1 kg of rice, two potatoes, 4 duck wings, a pear and two eggs, spending a total of 10 yuan.
