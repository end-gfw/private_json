Kim Yo-jong, vice minister of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, made tough speeches for three consecutive days, accusing the South Korean military of sending drones to spread anti-North Korean leaflets in Pyongyang and warning that if South Korean drones appear again, it will be regarded as a declaration of war. He also said that if the sovereignty of a nuclear-armed country is violated by forces domesticated by the United States, then its owner (the United States) should be held responsible. The South Korean military denied that it had sent drones, suspecting that it was a self-directed and self-acted performance by the North Korean side, and issued a warning on the 13th that if the safety of South Korean citizens is endangered, the North Korean regime will end.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/14/1845837370215571520_0.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1845841578494935496","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-10-14 22:58:21","content":"On October 14, the Nobel Prize in Economics was announced and was awarded to three American scholars, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A.
