Anchor Li Moumou said that he bought a batch of Chinese cultural relics lost overseas in Southeast Asia, but he offended a mysterious Japanese family and was hunted down. He was unable to bring the antiques back to China. Li Moumou used the slogan of \"protecting China\" to ask for help. Patriotic fans buy the antiques and recycle them at a high price when they return home. After investigation, the police found that the antiques he sold were actually cheap handicrafts. Li Moumou and his accomplices made illegal profits of more than 700,000 yuan, and are currently under criminal detention.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/18/1846956523639263595_0.jpg,","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true}]
