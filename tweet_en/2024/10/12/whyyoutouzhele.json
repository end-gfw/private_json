A man surnamed Tian was sentenced to ten months in prison for selling wild hair algae online. Tian runs two shops online, purchasing hair algae from other places for a long time and selling them in the name of original ecological local specialties. In less than two years, Tian illegally purchased 61.1 kilograms of wild hair algae, with sales exceeding 34,000 yuan. It is reported that hair algae, which is homophonic to \"get rich\", grows in plateau arid areas and is deeply loved by the Chinese people, so it is predatory. In order to strengthen protection, on September 7, 2021, hair algae was selected into the \"National Key Protected Wild Plant List\", with a protection level of Level I, and illegal collection and sale are prohibited.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844780825893580847_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844780825893580847_1.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1844781296133775534","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-10-12 00:45:10","content":"On October 10, the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh met with the leaders of the Bangladeshi student movement and praised the courage and wisdom shown by the young generation of Bangladesh represented by them in the student movement.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844781296133775534_0.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1844782104812363803","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-10-12 00:48:22","content":"On October 11, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the Japanese Council of Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Victims in recognition of the organization's long-term efforts to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844782104812363803_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844782104812363803_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844782104812363803_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844782104812363803_3.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1844787634477871179","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-10-12 01:10:21","content":"On October 11, at 3 a.m. in Qingyuan, Guangdong, a netizen took a photo of two children picking up trash on the street.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/12/1844787634477871179_0.jpg,","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true}]
