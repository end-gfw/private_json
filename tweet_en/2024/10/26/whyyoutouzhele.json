Unexpectedly, he received an administrative warning from Huawei.\nIt is reported that Huawei's European Town in Xiliu Beipo Village, Songshan Lake, Dongguan, was built according to 12 European towns or classic buildings such as Oxford, Windermere, Luxembourg, Bruges, Fribourg, Burgundy, Verona, Paris, Granada, Bologna, Heidelberg, and Kleinnov, with a total construction area of 1.26 million square meters. Through online searches, you can see many guides for visiting European towns. However, the area is not actually open to the public as Huawei's office area.",
