The Hang Seng Index plunged 2,336 points, hitting the biggest drop in nearly 16 years and falling below the 23,000-point mark; the Hang Seng Technology Index plunged more than 10% at one point; and the FTSE A50 Index futures also plunged more than 8%. Some analysts believe that the sharp drop in Hong Kong stocks may be related to the obvious weakening of the Fed's interest rate cut expectations and the huge increase in Chinese assets. Other analysts believe that the main reasons for the decline are that some investors cashed out and the National Development and Reform Commission did not release positive signals of quantitative easing.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/08/1843670947733102917_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/08/1843670947733102917_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/08/1843670947733102917_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2024/10/08/1843670947733102917_3.jpg,","videos":"","hasFullContentTranslated":true,"hasPublished":true},{"id":"1843674147282616748","name":"李老师不是你老师","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele","sensitive":false,"createdDate":"2024-10-08 23:25:45","content":"On the evening of October 8, several listed companies issued announcements on shareholder reductions.
