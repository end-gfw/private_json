    "content": "Four hours ago, the blogger released an uncut video to prove that he had indeed cut the jersey with the signature. I sincerely apologize to this blogger. I am sorry. After getting up this morning, I received screenshots from some netizens. In order to verify, I went to the blogger's account, but I did not see the signature because of the video compression. At the same time, because I had seen many people questioning on Twitter and the blogger's comment area before, I was subjective. I am sorry for the impact of the hasty release of this video on his reputation. I have deleted the original video now, but I will not delete this apology, hoping to recover some of the damage caused to him by my fault.\nI need to explain that the picture I used was a screenshot of the video on Douyin, and I did not deliberately use PS to discredit the blogger (otherwise I would not have released the video together.\nI apologize again for the trouble caused to this blogger. I am sorry. In the future, I will be more cautious when facing such personal materials.",
