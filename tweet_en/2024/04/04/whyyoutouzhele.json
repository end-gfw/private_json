He also harassed other female students in the second year of high school. Angry students wrote down the student's evil deeds in the audience seats of the school playground with chalk and demanded that he drop out of school.\nAfter learning about this, the school tried to suppress it and wiped off the graffiti on the wall three times in one day. The school claimed that the student was under great psychological pressure and was afraid that it would affect his future as the college entrance examination was approaching, so it would not punish him. A student from Hainan Middle School said in a forum that the school would deduct five quantitative points for being late, but repeated cheating and secretly photographing the female toilet were ignored because they wanted to take care of the senior high school students.",

Jin Zongbo is one of the victims of this dispute. Since the end of 2006, Jin Zongbo has submitted more than 700 letters of appeal, accusation and denunciation. The various paper materials were packed in 13 boxes, which were piled up nearly four meters high. On June 12, 2017, Jin Zongbo made a public report under his real name.",
