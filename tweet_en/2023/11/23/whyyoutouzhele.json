He has accumulated a lot of wealth through these industries. While making money, he has also made a very great contribution to the local economy and donated to many projects.\nOn April 14, 2022, Wei Chaoguang was arrested by Hengshui Public Security Bureau for the crime of provoking trouble. After more than half a year of investigation, he was transferred to the procuratorate on the grounds of being involved in organized crime. During this period, dozens of suspects in the same case as Wei Chaoguang were placed under designated residential surveillance in a hotel in Hengshui. During the three-month designated residence period, almost all lawyers were not allowed to meet with him for more than 40 days. After being transferred to the detention center, many suspects reported to their lawyers that the Hengshui Public Security Special Case Team had tortured them by means of electric shock, beatings, long-term tiger benches, and deprivation of food and sleep. One of the co-defendants even broke the toilet lid and cut his artery to commit suicide because he could not bear the torture. These inhumane methods are horrifying just to imagine! For a disabled person who has been paralyzed since childhood and cannot walk, facing the violent beatings of tall and burly policemen, not only is he unable to resist, but almost every punch is fatal! \nOn the morning of November 20, at the trial of the Wei Chaoguang case in Hebei, the defendant's attorney Ma Yaodong was deprived of the right to ask questions by the court's Dong Zhaojun (judge) because he asked him about torture and forced confession. The reason was that the defendant's lawyer asked about torture and forced confession, which was a restricted topic and was not allowed to be asked. Subsequently, many lawyers related to the case were driven out of the court by the judge of Zaoqiang County Court in Hebei Province.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/11/23/1727673266565767460_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1727673614877528171","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-11-23
