    "content": "On November 11, \"Changzhou Huali\" announced that its chairman Cheng Yong was coerced into admitting that he was involved in accepting 8 million deposits and cash bribes, and he jumped off the building unjustly. In his suicide note, Cheng Yong said that he was interviewed by the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and was involved in the loan issue of the deputy district mayor. At first, he just wanted to pay the money and leave as soon as possible, but he didn't expect to be caught in a dilemma. It's a bit hard in there, and the days are like years. All the evidence is a coincidence that happened to be guessed. I don't want to suffer anymore. Bye!",
