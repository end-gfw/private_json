Instead, the winning bids were \"fake orchestras\" launched by Chinese brokerage companies. These orchestras were temporarily put together by informal groups and imitated the names and images of well-known orchestras.\nThese fake orchestras appeared not only because of their low cost, but also because they were more likely to accept repertoire censorship and even play red songs to cater to the political atmosphere.\nDue to this unfair competition and censorship pressure, some European professional orchestras and chamber music groups even considered giving up their tour plans in China.\nThe email also mentioned that the director of the conducting department of the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria, was subjected to extreme scrutiny when planning to visit China, including background checks from kindergarten and complicated security documents.",

Stomach problems, cervical spondylosis and high blood pressure caused by long-term driving make it difficult for them to change jobs.\nIn addition, uncertainty and extreme situations in the working environment are also common problems.\nNetizens lamented that \"everything is convenient in China, which is based on treating people as non-human beings\"",
