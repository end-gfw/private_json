He accused the invasion of Ukraine of being a \"lie concocted by the military's top brass\". It shows that the contradiction between him and the Ministry of Defense can no longer be reconciled. \nIn the early morning of June 24, a Russian TV channel was hacked and began to play the recording of Wagner leader Prigozhin. Moscow then entered a state of alert, and armored vehicles that were stepped up could be seen everywhere at intersections near government agencies. \nAccording to Reuters, Prigozhin accused the Ministry of Defense of killing 2,000 of his own soldiers in the Telegram channel, and said: \"Those who destroyed our young people and the lives of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers will be punished. I ask everyone (along the way) not to resist.\" \nThe Kremlin said that President Vladimir Putin had been informed and \"is taking the necessary measures.\" \nThe Ministry of Defense said it would prosecute Prigozhin for armed rebellion.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/06/24/1672379949951352833_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1672380005857345537","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-06-24 07:03:59","content":"Related Reading","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/p3iBCNf3fx","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1672592822740893696","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-06-24 21:09:38","content":"Netizen contribution\nAs the civil war in Russia develops today, \"清君侧\" has become a blocked word on Weibo.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/06/24/1672592822740893696_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/hiZl7yykvT","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1672595900336570368","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-06-24 21:21:52","content":"Netizen contributions\nIn Hu Xijin's comment section, netizens started a big discussion on whether the army belongs to the \"Party\" or the \"People\".","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/06/24/1672595900336570368_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/06/24/1672595900336570368_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/06/24/1672595900336570368_2.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/1hwZPwXPdD","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1672615325634895874","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-06-24 22:39:03","content":"Breaking news\nThe Kalinuski Regiment of the Belarusian Volunteer Army fighting in Ukraine issued a notice to the Belarusian people announcing the uprising\n\"The favorable moment has arrived to free the country from dictatorship and occupation.
