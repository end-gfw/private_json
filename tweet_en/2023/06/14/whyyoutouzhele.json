    "content": "Netizen contribution\nOn June 13, an old farmer in Fujian was fined 100,000 yuan for selling vegetables for a profit of 14 yuan, which was reported by many media and attracted attention.\nIt is reported that an old farmer in Fujian sold vegetables of substandard quality in 2019 and was investigated by the local Municipal Supervision Bureau in 2021. On April 22, 2022, the Municipal Supervision Bureau made a decision to fine the old farmer 50,000 yuan, and later added another 50,000 yuan, totaling 100,000 yuan. Because the old man was unable to pay the fine, the Municipal Supervision Bureau applied to the Minhou Court for compulsory execution against the old man. However, the Minhou Court believed that the Municipal Supervision Bureau's decision to fine the old man was too heavy and the procedure was illegal, so it was not enforced.",
