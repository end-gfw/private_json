    "content": "Netizen contribution\nOn the evening of June 10, Wu Ming, who had previously become popular on the Internet for sharing his experience of joining the army in Wagner, published a new video to refute the rumor that he had been killed.\nHe also published a long article to disclose that the reason why he went to Russia to join the army was because he failed to eliminate gangs and evil in China and was targeted by the village party secretary. He listed a large number of names in the article, and ultimately failed to petition. He was even unable to visit Tiananmen Square because of his petition record, so he was forced to leave his motherland and go to Russia.\nIn the article, Wu Min said that he went to fight the United States and NATO to avenge the bombing of the Yugoslav Embassy. He only loves China and will never do anything to hurt China.",
