    "content": "Netizen submission, June 14.\nRecently, news about \"Fukushima will discharge nuclear waste water again\" has attracted attention inside the Great Firewall.\nHowever, a blogger found through comparison that the discharge standard of Fukushima nuclear waste water, which has been reviewed and approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency, is actually higher than the existing standard in China.\nBy comparison, the tritium dilution standard for Fukushima this time is 1500 becquerel per liter, while the standard set by Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, which is also a coastal nuclear power plant located in Hangzhou Bay, in 2007 was 3700 becquerel per liter of tritium dilution, and it has not changed since then.\nIn other words, in the past 16 years, Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has been discharging nuclear waste water into Hangzhou Bay at a rate twice that of Fukushima.\nAt the same time, China's \"Regulations on Environmental Radiation Protection of Nuclear Power Plants GB6249-2011\" stipulates that the total amount of radioactive tritium discharged must be less than 7.5 times 10 to the 13th power becquerel per year. Japan plans to discharge 1 million tons in 2023. Based on the seawater density of 1,100 grams per liter and the concentration of 1,500 becquerel per liter, the annual discharge is about 1.36 times 10 to the 12th power becquerel, which is far below the national standard. \nIn addition, the alarm threshold set by the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant is 10,000 becquerel per liter of radioactive tritium, which means that Fukushima's discharge plan is far less terrible than what is portrayed online. \nHowever, when the blogger posted this article on Xiaohongshu, he was immediately banned from the platform permanently.",
