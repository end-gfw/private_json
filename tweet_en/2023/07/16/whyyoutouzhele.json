However, after paying the medical examination fee at Wuhan Hansha Hospital, the intermediary immediately lost contact.\nBecause the amount was not high and could not meet the filing standard, there was no way to complain, and now they can only live on the streets in Wuhan.\nIt is reported that there are currently dozens of people who have been deceived. Only for a few dozen yuan in kickbacks, students from all over the country were deceived to Wuhan. This kind of case of defrauding kickbacks for medical examinations in the name of recruitment has also occurred frequently in the past.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/07/16/1680484914959990784_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/07/16/1680484914959990784_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/07/16/1680484914959990784_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/07/16/1680484914959990784_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1680485019834253312","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-07-16 15:50:25","content":"https://t.co/U4SkBLfkSZ","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/07/16/1680485019834253312_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/07/16/1680485019834253312_1.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/U4SkBLfkSZ","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1680494120643571720","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-07-16 16:26:35","content":"Netizen contribution\nRecently, some netizens discovered that the official website of Moscow State University lists \"Taiwan\" and \"China\" separately.\nOne netizen commented: \"Why is Russia not condemned for repeatedly making mistakes in insulting China?
