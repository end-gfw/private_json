Many middle-aged people who have devoted half their lives to Shenzhen will have to face the problem of leaving this land where they are about to take root.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/07/03/1675575725267582978_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1675580314045775872","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-07-03 03:00:52","content":"There are rumors online that Huaxi Nuclear, which previously engaged in nucleic acid business, has begun to enter the housing rental market, and \"Zhang Hezi's unified rental housing\" has become a hot search.
