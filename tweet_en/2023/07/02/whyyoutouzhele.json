Now there are \"too many people and too few jobs\". A 12-hour loading and unloading day only earns 160 yuan, but there are still endless applicants, \"just pay and go\". It is difficult to find a job for those over 40 years old. Many people can't even afford a 20-yuan bunk bed a night, so they sleep in the streets and parks, causing the price of beds to fall.",
