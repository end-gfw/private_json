Soon, the things in the house were thrown on the roadside, the house was knocked down, and the scene was in a mess.\nThe reason why they insisted on holding on to the house was that the promised relocation house had not been delivered for two years and was unfinished.\nIt was useless to report it to the provincial government, because the problem would be sent back to the local government and there would be no solution.",

    "content": "[Midi's bizarre announcement triggers ridicule] On October 5, in response to the recent \"zero-yuan purchase\" incident at Nanyang Midi, Midi officially issued an announcement stating that the \"zero-yuan purchase\" at Nanyang Midi was caused by someone posting false information that \"the scene needs to be cleaned up after the music festival\", which triggered villagers to go and loot and steal. It also stated that some organizations maliciously defamed Nanyang and Midi. However, the ending was shocking, stating that there were a lot of \"stupid remarks\" that discredited Henan and Nanyang in the previous announcement. The deletion of the announcement was to restore peace to Henan and repay the kindness of the people of Nanyang. Those who tried to discredit Nanyang and Midi by buying traffic were like ants trying to shake trees. As soon as the announcement came out, it triggered ridicule from all the big Vs on the Internet regardless of their camps. Netizens lamented that Midi united everyone with its own strength.",
