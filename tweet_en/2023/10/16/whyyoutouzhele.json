He was also abused by patriotic netizens and was brutally opened by patriotic netizens. He was also insulted in private messages as a \"Jewish devil\"","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713586319975235935_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713586319975235935_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713586319975235935_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713586319975235935_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/BJUQRTvRGS","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713592072647643291","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 00:26:01","content":"@jakobsonradical ","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/CvaNYur9xK","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713605681033482473","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 01:20:06","content":"[The Chinese Embassy in Israel chose to warn between evacuating Chinese citizens and appeasing them] On October 15, the chat records of the Israeli study abroad group circulated on the Internet showed that the embassy still had no news about when to evacuate Chinese citizens, and the embassy basically did not respond to any questions, while the official media was still mocking Japan's evacuation and fake news. At the same time, the remarks of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wang Yi today were also shameful. Other countries around us have evacuated their citizens, only the Chinese have not left. \nThe only thing the embassy has done now is to call those who spoke fiercely in the group to warn them not to talk nonsense. And not to allow everyone to discuss the situation in the group. \nSome students joked that the embassy chose to warn between evacuating Chinese citizens and appeasing them.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713605681033482473_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713605681033482473_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713605681033482473_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713605681033482473_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713830014171414860","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 16:11:31","content":"No innuendo\nOn October 16, the recently popular \"Chongzhen: The Diligent King Who Lost His Country\" was notified that it would be removed from the shelves due to printing problems.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713830014171414860_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713830014171414860_1.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/DENF3nNmvw","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713836428574982336","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 16:37:00","content":"Weibo CEO Wang Gaofei said that in the past few years, the traffic of official media in the field of social current affairs has accounted for more than 80%, but it has dropped sharply in the past two years.\nThis shows that people would rather believe the conspiracy theories and rumors of patriotic big Vs than believe the official media.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713836428574982336_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/M1lCjmUnK2","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713837757276016941","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 16:42:17","content":"Obviously, no one wants to believe that the plot in \"Wolf Warrior 2\" is fake.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713837757276016941_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713837757276016941_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713837757276016941_2.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/W4KEIN7o8A","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713838758196342895","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 16:46:16","content":"Some netizens revealed that the leaders of Jiangxi University of Science and Technology issued a strict high school management system:","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713838758196342895_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713838758196342895_1.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/h6EyXe5Iln","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713842105011839082","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 16:59:34","content":"😃 ","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713842105011839082_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/reE7hVfJdf","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713844519957905598","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 17:09:09","content":"On October 15, some netizens discovered that the bridge guards on Beijing Chaoyangmen Bridge had been replaced by armed police.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713844519957905598_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/10/16/1713844519957905598_1.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/KMWr80Lcw9","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1713852099547607102","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-10-16 17:39:17","content":"@big_ear_cat The official Weibo of Diba must be anxious, the public IP was opened for him.
