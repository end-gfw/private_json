    "content": "Hu Xijin posted a post late at night, imagining a war in the Taiwan Strait.\nHe believes that peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is no longer possible, and the only way out is armed reunification. However, the People's Liberation Army does not fight unprepared wars. The Taiwan Strait war must meet three conditions before it can be started: the number of nuclear bombs should reach more than 1,000; it must have the ability to go to war with the United States, Japan, Australia and Taiwan at the same time; it must be able to drop more than 10,000 bombs on the main island of Taiwan within one day.\nSo it seems that he means that there will be no war in the short term.",
