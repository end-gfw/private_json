A can-shaped object broke apart, injuring two people and a Chinese man in his 40s was arrested. The arrested man confessed that he did not intentionally cause the explosion, claiming that the liquid in the can was a cleaning agent from the workplace, which he brought back to his residence for use. The police suspected that the chemical reaction between the cleaning agent and the materials in the coffee can may have caused the explosion.",
