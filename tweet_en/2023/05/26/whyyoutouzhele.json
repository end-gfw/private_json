Instead, the decent No. 1 Zhang Yi, who was previously criticized by netizens for his mediocre performance, was nominated for the best actor, causing netizens to speak up for Zhang Songwen.\nThe incident quickly escalated from an acting issue to an ideological dispute, and some netizens even raised the banner of \"the big villain should not be nominated.\"",
