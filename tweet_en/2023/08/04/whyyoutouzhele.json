    "content": "On August 3, China’s Ministry of National Defense published an editorial in the People’s Liberation Army Daily: “The Party’s absolute leadership over the military is the foundation of the people’s army and the soul of a strong army.” “Our army holds guns and is an armed group that carries out the party’s political tasks. Loyalty to the party must be unique, thorough, unconditional, without any impurities, and without any water. The key to absolute loyalty to the party lies in the word “absolute”, ensuring that the gun is always in the hands of people who are loyal and reliable to the party. All officers and soldiers of the army deeply understand the decisive significance of the “two establishments” and must be highly conscious politically, ideologically, and in action, and unswervingly obey the command of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and Chairman Xi.”",

    "content": "On August 3, a very unique basketball game took place. In the National Youth U17 Women's Basketball Final, the Shandong team won the runner-up despite a 33-point victory over their opponents. The reason is that according to the competition rules, the ranking of the game is based on a comprehensive assessment of multiple indicators such as game scores, quality, technical standards, and technical evaluation. Therefore, the Shandong team, which was relatively low in physical tests and technical evaluations, could only be the runner-up.",
