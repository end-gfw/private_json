It was not connected to the national power grid and the water supply network. The water and electricity were unstable for a long time, and the property management did nothing. After the power outage lasted for nearly 24 hours, angry owners blocked the national highway at the entrance of the community. A large number of police, auxiliary police, and special police came to maintain stability, and conflicts broke out during the period. Several owners were taken away. At present, some buildings in the community have received electricity, and the residents' demands have changed from water and electricity to releasing the people.",
