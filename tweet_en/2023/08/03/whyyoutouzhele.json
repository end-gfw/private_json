The villagers found and stopped them. The villagers and the police confronted each other for 7 minutes.\nThe villagers at the scene questioned 4 points:\n1. Why did they dig the embankment of our village when there was a flood discharge area?\n2. Since there was no official document, is it a crime for these people to dig the embankment privately?\n3. There are still elderly people and children in the village. If we were not here to guard the embankment, the village would be gone now.\n4. Since the people and the police are not in opposition, why did they bring so many police here? To help us protect the embankment?","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686860385272406018_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1686860735505219584","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-08-03 06:05:14","content":"Afterwards, the villagers on the embankment clashed again with the police in the police car.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686860735505219584_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/5z19GZ4HNc","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1686861144969895937","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-08-03 06:06:51","content":"https://t.co/CtClnRDFG8","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686861144969895937_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686861144969895937_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686861144969895937_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686861144969895937_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/CtClnRDFG8","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1686862566679515137","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-08-03 06:12:30","content":"On August 2, after the official media reported that \"villagers refused to leave after being notified of flood discharge\", people began to wonder whether Zhuozhou had actually notified them of the flood discharge.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862566679515137_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862566679515137_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862566679515137_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862566679515137_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/OxIrUkddd6","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1686862810477645830","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-08-03 06:13:29","content":"The contributor originally thought that there were too many posts and there was no need to take screenshots, but later he found that some of them disappeared while he was reading them, so he took some screenshots and spliced them together.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862810477645830_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862810477645830_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862810477645830_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/08/03/1686862810477645830_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/Twc7bspC1a","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1687027618221027328","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-08-03 17:08:22","content":"On August 3, netizens posted the current situation of Zhuozhou, Hebei after the flood discharge.
