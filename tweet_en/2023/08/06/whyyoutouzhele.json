I think anyone who works in the cultural industry in China should have a deep understanding of it.\nNow, the unconscious behavior of patriotic artists has shown this cultural aesthetic to the world in a way that is not shameful.\nThis direct display of China's image is an effect that the Chinese government cannot achieve no matter how much money it spends on YouTube and Twitter.\nAnyone who sees it will say thank you to the patriotic students.",
