Some parents showed the content of the notice to reporters and said that initially it was 440 yuan to order 4 boxes, and only a dozen families participated in the order.\nAnother student revealed that the teacher had urged parents to participate in the order through students many times. The student said: \"If you don't order, (the teacher) will call, and my teacher said that we have to order.\" When asked about the consequences of not ordering, a parent present said \"If you don't order, it will be bad for the children.\"","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700558923063824885_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1700582989288120749","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-10 02:52:34","content":"Xu Jijun, a columnist for Russia Today and former editor-in-chief of Global Finance, who entered Mariupol with Wang Fang, published \"Mariupol people reveal the truth about the opera house tragedy\" on his public account \"Han Tang Think Tank\".\nHe said that \"(the Ukrainian army took the people in the theater) as hostages to threaten the Russian army not to attack. Later, (the Ukrainian army) created an explosion and falsely accused it of being a missile, but experts said that the explosion could only be from the bottom up...\"\nAlthough he said that the theater was detonated by the Ukrainian army from inside the theater, we can see the shocking tragedy in the theater after the bombing from his video.\nIn addition, the video also recorded the official shooting of Wang Fang's singing. In this version, Wang Fang was standing in the ruins with her head held high and her chest held high, singing loudly. It is speculated that it should be the material originally planned to be filmed for cutting into the promotional video, and the version previously circulated on the Internet was the vocal practice version.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700582989288120749_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1700585477928067499","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-10 03:02:27","content":"Why are there so many pathological military trainings this year?\nAt 2:40 a.m. on September 10, a student started a live broadcast saying\nHainan Vocational and Technical College is still conducting military training at this moment","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700585477928067499_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/SVP1PKMEI6","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1700593667478585816","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-10 03:35:00","content":"@music3club 2.8 in one month, awesome 👍","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1700613104038470136","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-10 04:52:14","content":"Use the Pelosi incident to explain the \"Public Security Administration Punishment Law\":","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700613104038470136_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/bu03uKlms4","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1700816515337945411","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-10 18:20:31","content":"Netizen contribution\nOn September 9, a netizen posted a video saying that a school in Fujian Province conducted security checks on students entering the school.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700816515337945411_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/H7IxIREd66","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1700817363208118683","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-10 18:23:53","content":"Recently, a post on Xiaohongshu titled \"Take Mom to Remove IUD\" reminded many netizens of the hardships their mothers went through during the family planning period.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700817363208118683_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700817363208118683_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700817363208118683_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/10/1700817363208118683_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/C8Gw00tknU","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1700818021080592563","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-10 18:26:30","content":"September 9, Zhejiang\nA girl fainted in the classroom, and no one came forward to help her.
