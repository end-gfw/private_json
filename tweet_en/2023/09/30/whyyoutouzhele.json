They also said that the current issue is no longer whether to compensate the old lady, but the issue of \"colluding with foreign anti-China forces.\"\nThe old lady's son also received a call from a member of the Internet Monitoring Brigade who called himself Kong Xiangfeng, notifying the old lady's son who worked in Shenzhen to return to his hometown and said that he wanted to ask him about the situation. The family asked for written procedures and to talk on the phone, but was rejected by the other party.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/30/1708056030926557565_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/30/1708056030926557565_1.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/30/1708056030926557565_2.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/09/30/1708056030926557565_3.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1708057557984591907","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-09-30 17:53:50","content":"So you see, don’t stare at me and say that the news I posted affected others.
