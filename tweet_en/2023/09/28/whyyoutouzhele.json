    "content": "On September 27, in Nanchang, Jiangxi, it was reported online that a female homeowner in a residential area was suddenly slapped in the face during a negotiation with a company employee. The homeowner said that there was an office building apartment in the residential area, and the company had its office in it. There was an iron fence separating the residential area and the office building. The company's people wanted to connect the residential area and the office building, and they took scissors to cut the fence in the morning. The homeowner went to stop them after knowing about it. When she went to their company to argue, the female homeowner was slapped in the face. After receiving the alarm, the local police station took the attacker and the victim to the police station. At present, both parties are handling the case. The owner who was beaten did not have obvious external injuries but went to the hospital for treatment.",
