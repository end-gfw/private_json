At first, everyone thought it was norovirus, but more and more people said that they went to the hospital for examination and found that it was a bacterial infection and norovirus negative, which aroused students' suspicion.\nAs of noon on September 29, in the documents spontaneously counted by students, more than 300 students had symptoms, and the results of hospital examinations were almost all bacterial, and none of them were confirmed to have norovirus. This document was posted on the Tree Hole at around 8 pm on September 28. The post was deleted about ten minutes later, and then it should have been spread among classmates through WeChat. From the number of people who filled in the form, it can be roughly inferred that at least thousands of people were involved this time.\nOn the other hand, the school officially released a health reminder about norovirus on the BBS in the afternoon of September 28, and the school began to delete posts intensively. The relevant discussions were basically deleted within a few minutes. By noon on the 29th, almost all discussions on Peking University's Tree Hole and BBS were deleted.",
