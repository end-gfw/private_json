On April 27, 2021, Chongqing California Property Service Co., Ltd. withdrew from Taiguang Property Management, and Chongqing Tongjing Property Management Co., Ltd. officially entered Taiguang Property Management.\nFigure 3 is the current shareholding relationship of the property management company obtained through public channels.\nThe community itself is a commercial and residential building with a large flow of people. After one elevator stopped operating, only one elevator was still in operation. During peak hours, the elevators take a very long time to be in service, and the remaining elevators also have frequent problems during long-term high-intensity operation.\nBecause the problem has not been solved, the owners of the community gathered in the community garage on September 19, blocking vehicles from entering and exiting to express their dissatisfaction. During the period, they clashed with the police, and some owners were taken away afterwards.",
