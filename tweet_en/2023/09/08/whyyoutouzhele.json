    "content": "On September 7, Russian media reported that Chinese singer Wang Fang performed a Soviet song \"Katyusha\" live in the ruins of the Mariupol Theater.\nThe ruins behind her were once a shelter. In March 2022, the Russian army dropped two 500-kilogram bombs on the site, killing at least a dozen civilians (some say 300), despite the huge \"Дети\" children written on the ground.\nIt is reported that this is a delegation of Chinese journalists, patriotic celebrities and public figures visiting the \"Donetsk Republic\".\nWang Fang, a Chinese folk singer, is the wife of Zhou Xiaoping, a famous Chinese patriotic celebrity.\nIt is worth noting that she wore a belt from Chanel, a famous brand that insults China, when she sang.\n",
