A female high school student posted online that on the evening of December 9, her head teacher Zheng molested her during a dorm inspection after drinking. On the 16th, the girl posted an administrative penalty letter from the Jimo Branch of the Qingdao Public Security Bureau. The decision showed that Zheng's illegal behavior of molesting was established and decided to give Zheng administrative detention for 10 days. \nLater, the girl posted again that after the incident, she was absent-minded and confused for several days, and asked her family for help, but the school prevaricated her and her family and gave three reasons: First, it was afraid of delaying other students' college entrance examinations, and Zheng could not be expelled at present; second, it could not confess this matter to Zheng's wife, and the family was also an innocent party; the third reason was to take into account Zheng's social image. Once this matter was made public, what if he could not bear the pressure and committed suicide. \nOn December 17, a reporter contacted the office of Qingdao Jimo District Experimental High School, and the staff said. It is true that Zheng molested a female student. Since the incident, the school has actively intervened, and the police and the Education Bureau have also intervened. The next step is for the Discipline Inspection Commission to intervene, and the school will punish the teacher in accordance with the law. \nThat afternoon, the victimized female student posted a message saying that the school did not actively intervene, but the police intervened one day before the result. Previously, the school did not handle it a week after the incident, and kept evading the issue that we would handle it.",

A mother posted a video saying that her daughter was 17 years old and was in the third year of high school at Xiaguan No. 3 Middle School in Dali City. She had excellent grades and had won the title of outstanding class cadre many times.\nOn December 8, the school organized students to visit Dali University. During the visit, because the daughter used a mobile phone to take pictures during the visit, the head teacher asked the daughter to write a self-criticism and invite her parents to come.\nOn December 9, the school said that the daughter cheated in the exam without any evidence and talked to her. After the daughter came out of the office, she was depressed and then jumped off the building and died.\nAfter the incident, the family rushed to the school to ask to see the surveillance video of the falling place, but the school said that the surveillance camera could not be viewed because the wiring was not used. However, a student at the school revealed that the camera was usable and the surveillance camera here was adjusted a few weeks ago because of lost items.\nOn December 15, the family members and the school agreed to go to the Dali City Judicial Office for an interview, but the school staff asked them to wait for a long time. The family members were disappointed with the school's attitude. Now it has been 9 days since the daughter fell from the building. The mother was hospitalized due to excessive grief. Xiaguan No. 3 Middle School has not yet come forward to give an explanation, and the daughter is still lying in the funeral home.",
