    "content": "A Shandong woman was insulted by the director of the petition office when she went to petition. She was sentenced to blackmail after receiving compensation of 20,000 yuan.\nIn early 2019, 32-year-old Li Lu reported that she was sexually assaulted by Shi, her class teacher and mathematics teacher, when she was in the third grade of junior high school at Yangxin County Experimental Middle School in Shandong Province. Shi continued to harass her when she was in high school and college. The Yangxin County Public Security Bureau of Shandong Province stated that because Li Lu's alleged assault was only accused by herself and there was no other evidence, it did not meet the conditions for filing a case.\nSince then, Li Lu has had conflicts with Shi many times, during which Li Lu was beaten by Shi. After the public security organs intervened, Li Lu was dissatisfied with the result and filed an administrative lawsuit against the public security organs, which was supported by the court. However, the public security organs have been slow to execute the court's judgment, so Li Lu began to petition.\nOn July 29, 2022, when Li Lu was petitioning at the Yangxin Petition Bureau, she was insulted by Liu, the director of the Petition Bureau. Li Lu posted the on-site video to the social platform, and Liu was dismissed the next day. Li Lu then asked the Xinyang County Government, the Letters and Calls Bureau, and Liu to compensate for mental damages of 100,000 yuan each, totaling 300,000 yuan.\nOn August 28, 2022, Liu agreed to compensate 100,000 yuan and transferred 20,000 yuan to Li Lu on the spot. On September 2, 22, Liu reported to the police that he was blackmailed by Li Lu. On September 9, 22, Li Lu was detained for suspected blackmail.\nOn August 25, 2023, the Yangxin County Court of Shandong sentenced Li Lu to two years and two months in prison for blackmail and infringement of personal information, and a fine of 7,000 yuan. Li Lu appealed.\nOn November 23, 2023, it was originally the day when the court notified Li Lu of the second trial, but on the eve of the trial, Li Lu's family received a notice that the trial time was postponed.",
