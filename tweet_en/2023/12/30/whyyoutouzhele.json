    "content": "Recently, freshmen of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts posted big-character posters at the entrance of male and female dormitories, criticizing the teaching system of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The article stated that the Academy of Fine Arts requires freshmen of all disciplines to undergo a one-year realistic painting training. This type of course has no connection with their future majors at all, and is just similar to the painting training during the art examination.\nThis practice has seriously ignored the objective reality and the current development of art history. It is a simple, crude and seriously backward teaching concept. This education model has seriously affected the students' academic level and creative ability.\nAfterwards, the school tore down the big-character posters.\nThe next day, the students drew three boxes on the torn wall and wrote \"There used to be 3 A4 papers here.\"\nAfter that, the school used spray paint to cover the text.",
