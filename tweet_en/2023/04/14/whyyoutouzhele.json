After the two learned that an epidemic broke out in Suifenhe City, Mudanjiang, they did not comply with the relevant regulations on epidemic prevention and control, and did not report their trip to Suifenhe City, Mudanjiang. Afterwards, both were diagnosed with new coronavirus pneumonia, resulting in 183 people in Suizhong County being infected and 7,865 people being quarantined. The county has successively demarcated 34 closed-off areas, control areas and key prevention areas, and opened 61 isolation sites. Suizhong County’s finances have spent a total of about 155 million yuan on various epidemic emergency response expenses.",
