According to previous media reports, on the 26th, in the third round of the Chinese Super League, Chengdu Rongcheng drew 0-0 with Dalian away. After the game, Chengdu Rongcheng players were thrown debris and insulted for no reason when they left the field, and some words were extremely racist; the Chengdu Rongcheng team's fan expedition was surrounded when they left the field and could not leave the field for a long time. Some Chengdu fans were besieged by some local extreme fans after leaving the field.\nAmong them, a netizen named \"Fernandoschick\" posted on Weibo that all Chengdu Rongcheng fans should die for their compatriots who died in the 512 earthquake. However, at 10:23 that night, the netizen apologized on Weibo and said that the 512 earthquake was the pain of all Chinese people and should not be ridiculed at will. Later, some fans and netizens discovered that the person who made the above inappropriate remarks to attack Rongcheng fans was Liu Moumou, a student at the China Medical University in Liaoning Province. After being discovered and reported by fans, Liu Moumou deleted the relevant remarks and apologized. The student has now cancelled his account.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/29/1652262039119704066_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/29/1652262039119704066_1.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652285709594640384","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 20:16:25","content":"Netizen contribution\nAbandoned nucleic acid laboratory on the roadside in Zhengzhou, Henan","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/29/1652285709594640384_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/rjCuuJxQX7","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652293054538104832","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 20:45:36","content":"Netizen contribution\nAfter the recent explosion of popularity of \"Zibo BBQ\", a large number of parents of abducted children went to Zibo to spread the information.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/29/1652293054538104832_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/u6BB3XUo2Y","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652293745394479104","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 20:48:21","content":"Netizen contribution\nOn April 29, the Beijing Xuetong News Agency WeChat official account published an article titled \"A Blank Sheet of Paper\" with the caption \"I will remember November 26, 2022, and I will remember the courage of media professionals.\"\nIt is reported that the Beijing Xuetong News Agency is a semi-official student union organization under the Beijing Youth Daily, which is supervised by the Beijing Youth Daily, the newspaper of the Beijing Communist Youth League.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/29/1652293745394479104_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/CbddLD9YCo","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652293854823849984","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 20:48:47","content":"Original URL: https://t.co/EJGPQeqHk8\nOriginal URL archive:","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/vnvMD3LZyb","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652295009415184384","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 20:53:23","content":"@dutyhawker8964 New trick","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652300591542988802","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 21:15:33","content":"Subsequent supplement","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/29/1652300591542988802_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/rJv7lykG3I","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652316119053529091","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 22:17:15","content":"@realFangYi Thanks for the correction","images":"","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1652326084199829505","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-29 22:56:51","content":"Thank you friends at the music festival.
