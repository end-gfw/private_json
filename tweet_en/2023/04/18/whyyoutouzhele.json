(In fact, I did not engage in teaching or study abroad business in Milan) But considering the impact of my existence, the school terminated all cooperation and business with me.\nIn March, a Chinese in Italy (news materials showed that he was the chairman of a multinational tourism group) went to the house where I lived when I was in school and wanted to \"talk\" with me.\nIn April, my NetEase BUFF and Alipay were successively frozen by the court.\nSo far, all my sources of income have been cut off by relevant Chinese authorities.",
