    "content": "Netizen contribution\nOn April 23, Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye's remarks during an interview with a French TV station caused an uproar and were accused of losing control of his remarks.\nAccording to AFP, during the interview, when asked whether Crimea belongs to Ukraine, Lu Shaye said: \"Not necessarily, it depends on how we look at the issue... The issue is not that simple.\"\nThe host reminded Lu Shaye: \"According to international law, Crimea belongs to Ukraine.\"\nLu Shaye said, \"According to international law, these former Soviet countries are not substantive sovereign states because there is no international agreement to specifically define their sovereign state status.\"\nThe reporter asked: \"According to you, the borders of these former Soviet countries have not been demarcated?\" Lu Shaye: \"Don't quibble anymore.\" The reporter asked, \"If a piece of Chinese land is cut off by someone, someone says, don't quibble anymore...\" Lu Shaye did not respond.\nThis incident caused a shock to the international community. On the 23rd, nearly 80 European parliamentarians jointly published an open letter in the French newspaper Le Monde, calling on French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna to take action against Lu Shaye's \"shameless attack\" and announce the expulsion of Lu Shaye as soon as possible.\nThe open letter emphasized that Lu Shaye's speech was a bad \"wolf warrior\" speech, which was very inappropriate in diplomatic language and clearly violated international law. It not only seriously insulted the history, culture and national dignity of the relevant countries, but also may pose a security threat to France's European allies. France should not sit idly by.\nMany governments lodged strong protests with China. Some commentators believed that Lu's remarks seriously affected the efforts brought about by the previous visit of French President Macron to China.\nAfterwards, the Chinese Embassy in France issued a statement on the French version of the website, stating that Lu Shaye's remarks were only personal opinions and could not represent China's foreign policy. However, this statement was not included in the Chinese version of the embassy's website.",
