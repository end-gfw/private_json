It's really annoying.\nI can only take up everyone's time here.\nThis matter is actually very simple.\nFirst, if I charged the contributors, it would not have been exposed until today.\nSecond, I deal with so many contributions every day. If I can collect money from this, then I don't have to raise money when something happens.\nThird, the biggest flaw in this lie is that many Twitter friends have said that Chinese Paypal accounts cannot donate to my donation link.\nSo this is a fake picture that is completely fictitious.\nThe above is the response to this matter. I think everyone should be able to understand it very easily.\nThe following is what I say to all the Twitter friends who support me:\nIn the past period of time, I have experienced a series of behaviors such as impersonating accounts, a large number of reports, water army flooding, slandering me for collecting contribution fees, and impersonating me to send private messages.\nToday, six months later, I am exhausted in reality, and I am always on the edge of the vortex on the Internet. But few people know that six months ago I was just an ordinary person who just graduated from school.\nI have no idea what the future holds, but because of your tolerance, support and encouragement, I believe I can do more and better for you.\nThank you all.\nNeither you nor I will fall.","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/27/1651355494391463938_0.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1651379323968925699","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-27 08:14:46","content":"Netizen contribution\nChinese warships at the scene of the evacuation of Chinese nationals from Sudan.\nAccording to relevant information, more than 1,100 Chinese have been safely evacuated from Sudan so far.","images":"","videos":"/tweet/video/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/27/1651379323968925699_0.jpg","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/uGTTlxE43j","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1651379482010189825","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-27 08:15:24","content":"https://t.co/iu6Pg31HGA","images":"/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/27/1651379482010189825_0.jpg,/tweet/image/whyyoutouzhele/2023/04/27/1651379482010189825_1.jpg","videos":"","hasPublished":false,"tweetShortURL":"https://t.co/iu6Pg31HGA","accountId":"whyyoutouzhele"},{"id":"1651385770249207809","name":"李老师不是你老师","createdDate":"2023-04-27 08:40:23","content":"Netizen contribution\nA 24-year-old female worker in Shanghai died suddenly.
