According to anonymous employees, the company had formed a team of about 100 people to explore Android phone vulnerabilities and develop exploits. These malicious functions were initially only targeted at users in rural areas and small towns, and improved personalized push effects by collecting user data. The team was disbanded in early March and the vulnerability exploit code was removed. However, security experts pointed out that the underlying code could still be reactivated to perform attacks. 20 core network security engineers remained in the company.",
