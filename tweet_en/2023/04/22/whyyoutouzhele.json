    "content": "On April 21, Shanwei, Guangdong\nDue to dissatisfaction with the reduction of unit price and treatment, Meituan deliverymen in Shanwei, Guangdong, went on strike collectively. That night, Meituan urgently dispatched deliverymen from other places with high unit price + exemption from overtime.\nIt is said that the treatment of deliverymen drawn from other places has exceeded the requirements of local deliverymen, causing dissatisfaction among the deliverymen. They believe that Meituan would rather spend more money to dispatch people from other places than to restore the unit price and subsidies originally belonging to local deliverymen.\nLocal netizens said that the feeling on the street now is that many Meituan riders are delivering food with license plates from other places. Because they have just arrived in a new environment, there are many riders looking around to check the navigation.",
