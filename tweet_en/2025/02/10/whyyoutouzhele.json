There was no real name in the entire article from beginning to end.\nTherefore, the reporter of this interview report did not exist, and the leader who was interviewed was unfounded.\nXiang Dongliang said that reports without the names of the interviewees would be judged by professionals as \"purely fictitious\"\nAt present, Xiang Dongliang's questioning article has been deleted.",
