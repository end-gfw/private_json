    "content": "On February 10, the Financial Times reported that Changxin Memory, China's leading memory chip producer, is teaming up with DeepSeek to rapidly erode the market share of Samsung and SK Hynix.

Its \"snowball-like\" growth threatens the dominance of Korean chips.\n\nAnalysts pointed out that since 2023, Changxin Memory has exploited a loophole in US export controls that has enabled it to use advanced US chip manufacturing equipment to help produce its most cutting-edge chips. The company was also removed from the latest blacklist by the US Department of Commerce last year, which prohibits any US company from doing business with it. Jimmy Goodrich, senior consultant for technology analysis at Rand Corporation Research, said: \"Even now, it is not entirely clear whether CXMT is subject to any restrictions.\"",
