At the memorial ceremony, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said that he would apologize on behalf of the country and pay tribute to the victims who bravely faced authoritarianism. In his speech, he used the word \"dictator\" to describe Chiang Kai-shek, and pointed out that China has not given up the military reunification of Taiwan.\nLai Ching-te said: The troops from the mainland have gone through the Northern Expedition, the Anti-Japanese War, the suppression of bandits, and years of war. \"Their living standards are certainly not comparable to those of Taiwanese society. They steal, rob, and destroy. The gap in living civilization has caused social outrage and resentment, and there has been a backlash. In addition, Chen Yi's troops were corrupted in military discipline, and the dictator Chiang Kai-shek committed heinous crimes in order to ensure that he could come to Taiwan to rule when the war situation on the mainland was retreating step by step.\"\nThe 228 Incident refers to the fierce conflicts between officials and the public that broke out in various parts of Taiwan from February 27 to May 16, 1947. The people demanded political reforms, and the National Government of the Republic of China eventually sent troops to suppress them by force.",
