A month ago, the Hong Kong police took action against Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute three times, and the chairman and chief executive Chung Ting-yiu and two staff members were taken back to the police station to assist in the investigation.\nThe predecessor of Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute was the Hong Kong University Public Opinion Research Project established in 1991. In the past, it would regularly publish various special surveys on government officials' popularity, Hong Kong people's identity and attitudes towards the \"June 4th\" incident. It has long been taking the pulse of society and has been widely cited by the media and academic research, becoming one of the indicators of Hong Kong's public sentiment.",
