The man said that Jiangsu Satellite TV interviewed him, \"When relatives asked him some offensive questions, how would you answer?\" The man said that his answer at the time was \"Maybe others will say that my affairs have nothing to do with you, but I won't say that. I will communicate with my elders in a friendly manner.\" As a result, Jiangsu Satellite TV edited out \"My affairs have nothing to do with you\" and misinterpreted the man's original intention. https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1885363638120439808/pu/img/N3CClKHaF9RCrX47.jpg",
