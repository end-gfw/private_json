We are a national poverty-stricken county. After Mr. Li spoke out for these high schools, I was deeply touched and thanked Mr. Li for letting everyone know that all videos posted on Douyin were reported and removed by the school. Today I came to complain to Mr. Li about the exploitation of students and parents by Hunyuan Middle School.\nOn the fourth day of the Chinese New Year this year, February 1, our school started school. During the holiday, it was less than a week, not to mention the work and rest schedule, which was 6 am to 11 pm, very typical. But in such a poor area, the school still charges high custody fees. After the start of the double reduction, the state allows charging custody, and ours is obviously dozens of times higher than the charging standard. We have a holiday every two weeks, which means four days of custody a month. Before, the school often charged custody fees of 300-400 yuan from time to time, and never disclosed the custody time...",
