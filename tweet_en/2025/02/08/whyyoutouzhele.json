After being lifted out of poverty, he suffered from hunger and cold for two years, and was identified as a special poverty-stricken household, but has not received any benefits so far. Now his disability pension has also been cancelled, and he hopes that the relevant departments will give him a way out.\nBut then his account was blocked and the several videos he posted were deleted.",
