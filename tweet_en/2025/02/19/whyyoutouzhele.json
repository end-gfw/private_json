They were identified as participating in beating migrant workers and loan sharking, and the case was named the \"5.25\" case. Bao Qinrui and 9 other people in the same case were all placed under residential surveillance at a designated location. Thirteen days later, 34-year-old Bao Qinrui died. The indictment of the procuratorate alleges that from July 7 to July 19, 2022, Zhang Xuguang, Xing Zichao, Wang Ziqian, Wu Weitao and 8 others used torture to obtain the suspect's confession of guilt during the investigation of the \"5.25\" case. Bao Shaorui recalled that in the yard, he was put in a small iron cage and hung up, with his toes barely touching the ground. Some case officers poured water on his head, and then used a hand-cranked telephone to shock his genitals and waist. Except for the first defendant Zhang Xuguang, the other seven defendants were all born in the 1990s.",

    "content": "The Democratic Party, the first political party in Hong Kong, has been suppressed in recent years. Some pro-establishment media reported that this old party is planning to dissolve. In response, the party chairman Luo Jianxi only confirmed that the Central Committee will be convened tomorrow to discuss the party's future direction. As for whether it will include dissolution, he only said that there is no limit to the discussion. If there is any decision, it will be carried out in accordance with the party constitution, that is, it must be voted by the general meeting of members.\nSince opposing the amendment of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance in 2019, the Democratic Party has been targeted by the government and establishment forces. The refusal of Hong Kong government officials to meet is one example. It is difficult to get the nomination of the establishment when running for election. Since the Beijing government reformed the Hong Kong electoral system to ensure the implementation of \"patriots governing Hong Kong\", it has not participated in elections and cannot find a venue for organizing activities.",
