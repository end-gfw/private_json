    "content": "On February 17, the London Criminal Court in the UK charged Zou Zhenhao (transliteration), a 27-year-old Chinese doctoral student, with sexually assaulting 10 women while in the UK from 2019 to 2023. The prosecutor said that Zou Zhenhao looked like \"a smart and charming young man\", but in fact he was \"a habitual offender of sexual assault, voyeurism and rape.\" However, Zou Zhenhao denied all the charges and said that he was used to filming his sexual behavior with his sexual partner, and the pornographic photos and images were taken with the consent of the other party. The British police also searched his dormitory and found cameras. Zou Zhenhao argued that these actions were just out of curiosity. In addition, the police also found pictures of the anesthetic sevoflurane on his mobile phone, and Zou Zhenhao claimed that it was a mistaken shot caused by a malfunction of the mobile phone.",
