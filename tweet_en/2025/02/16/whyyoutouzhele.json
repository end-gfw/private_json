If we reach a mineral agreement with American companies in Ukraine, it will become more difficult to invade. At the same time, we need to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainian army, arm them to the teeth, give them a batch of F-16 fighter jets, and make any future invasion extremely difficult. This is a deterrent in itself. If Ukraine cannot join NATO now, my idea with Boris Johnson is to send a very clear message - tell Putin that if he invades Ukraine again, it will trigger Ukraine's automatic joining of NATO and become another cordon sanitaire. As long as we do these three things, he will not launch an invasion again. Otherwise, we will be back to square one and repeat the same mistakes.\"",
