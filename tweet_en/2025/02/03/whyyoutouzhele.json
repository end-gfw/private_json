He said that the purpose of imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico is to solve the fentanyl crisis in the United States, but now it seems that fentanyl is just an excuse, and tariffs are not a means. Tariffs themselves are Trump's purpose.\nThe report emphasized that even if economic analysis is put aside, according to the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement signed by Trump during his first presidency, the imposition of tariffs should not have happened. Trump tore up the agreement with his friends and ignored the obligation to fulfill the treaty, \"which will make other countries more inclined to refuse to reach an agreement with the United States.\" \n...",

Beijing is also said to intend to treat the TikTok deal as essentially a \"commercial issue\" and allow ByteDance to sell TikTok to interested US bidders.",
