For all Muslims who are physically and financially capable, the Hajj is a task that must be completed at least once in their lifetime.\n\nHowever, after the introduction of the Regulations on Religious Affairs in 2018, Chinese officials began to crack down on such pilgrimages. In 2020, Chinese officials required that all pilgrimages must be organized by the Chinese Islamic Association, which is affiliated with the United Front Work Department.\n\nBecause of these restrictions, Ma Yanhu stopped leading groups to Mecca in 2020 in accordance with the regulations, and only helped believers book air tickets and apply for visas.
