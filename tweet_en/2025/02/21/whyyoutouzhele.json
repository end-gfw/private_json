It is now impossible to guess what will happen next. Some officials have no motivation for fear of anti-corruption purges, and even simply lie flat and do nothing.\nBut as the economy slows, Chinese leaders need to launch new projects to attract investors. Now may be the time when the Chinese government can least tolerate officials' slackness.\nAccording to the People's Daily, at least three cities have begun to issue \"snail awards\". Punish and humiliate cadres who lie flat and do nothing. A video of an official TV program on Chinese social media showed several men in suits and expressionless faces receiving framed certificates.\nA district in Guangdong Province said they had established a database to track those \"officials who lie flat.\" Other places have also promoted their own...",
