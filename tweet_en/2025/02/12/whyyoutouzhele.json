This makes them vulnerable to the economic recession after the coronavirus pandemic, turmoil in the real estate market, and weak financial conditions of debt-ridden local governments.\nAccording to reports, the latest official data showed that the non-performing loan ratio of rural commercial banks reached 3.04% in the third quarter of last year, almost the entire non-performing loan ratio of the banking industry...",

    "content": "On February 10, Yunnan Hui Christian pastor Ma Yan was tried for \"organizing an illegal gathering.\" It is reported that Ma Yan pleaded guilty at the trial on February 10 because the charge of \"organizing an illegal gathering\" carries a lighter sentence than other charges and does not cause moral stigma. At present, the court has not yet made a verdict, but the prosecution recommended a sentence of 9 months.\nHuman rights organization CSW said: \"The arrest and prosecution of Pastor Ma Yan is another example of the Chinese Communist Party's targeting of ethnic and religious minorities and violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. CSW calls on the authorities to immediately release Pastor Ma Yan and declare him not guilty.\"",
