    "content": "Wang Renzhi, former head of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, who was known as the \"Left King\" of the Communist Party of China, died in Beijing on February 4 at the age of 92.\nWang Renzhi was from Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. He served as head of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China from January 1987 to November 1992. He adhered to traditional ideology and was known as the \"Left King\".\nIn 1990, the leftists in the party provoked a debate on \"capitalism or socialism\" in an attempt to influence the direction of reform and opening up. In the end, Deng Xiaoping's southern tour ended with the economic system being determined as a socialist market economy. Wang Renzhi, who was involved in the debate, was removed from the post of head of the Central Propaganda Department after the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and transferred to work at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",
