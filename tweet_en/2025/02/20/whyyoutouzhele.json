Yesterday, the Internet circulated the summaries of the speeches of six entrepreneurs at the meeting. Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said in his speech on the spot that although China has made remarkable progress in the fields of intelligent driving and semiconductors, it still needs to be wary of \"superficial prosperity covering up internal shortcomings.\"\n Ren Zhengfei said that the next five years will be a life-and-death window period for China's technology industry, and private enterprises must become the makers of global technology rules.\nHe also revealed that Huawei has launched \"Backup Plan 2.0\", joining forces with 2,000 Chinese companies to reconstruct the ecosystem in key areas such as semiconductors and industrial software, with the goal of achieving an autonomy rate of more than 70% for the entire industry chain by 2028.\n Wang Chuanfu, who was also present, believed that private enterprises should actively participate in global competition and expand international markets, and called on private enterprises to pay attention to the training and introduction of talents.",

Why doesn’t “Sleepy Biden” demand balance? After all, this war affects Europe far more than the United States — there is a vast, beautiful ocean between us.\nOn top of that, Zelensky admitted that half of the money we gave him “disappeared.” He refuses to hold elections, is extremely low in the polls in Ukraine, and the only thing he’s good at is…",
