Former journalist and current Beijing lawyer Li Hualiang published an article revealing that \"Xiao Huamei\" is still receiving treatment in the hospital and has not returned home to live or to her hometown in Yunnan. Local villagers in Fengxian said that their children are taken care of by the government and there are special people to provide security for their lives.\nSome villagers from other villages said that perhaps because of the impact of the Xiao Huamei incident, Dongji Village has renovated the road in the past two years, and the appearance of the village has been improved, but the atmosphere is still a little tense. People from other villages go to the village to do business and work, and if they want to enter the village, they will be questioned by the on-duty personnel in the village. Relatives and friends from other places must contact the villagers before they can enter.",
