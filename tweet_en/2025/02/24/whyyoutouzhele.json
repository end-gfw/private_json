He pointed out that developers quickly recovered funds through a high turnover model, but passed on construction risks to home buyers. When the market is down and the capital chain is tight, \"unfinished buildings\" become a black hole that devours family wealth. \nThis report has been deleted by major Chinese social media platforms. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gke__ZwaoAAkhwT.jpg",
