The heavy schoolbag not only bends the spine, but also the youth that should be brilliant and the soul that should be breathing freely.\n\nKnowledge should light up life, not extinguish hope.\nEducation should cultivate thinking, not weaken will.\nThe true meaning of education should not be competition above all else, and it should not be at the expense of children's physical and mental health.\n\nThis form is based on Google Form and is filled out anonymously. No login is required and no personal information will be recorded. But please be careful to protect your privacy...",

    "fullContent": "由于寒假提前开学的投稿太多，我们宣布发起\n“ 611Study .ICU，全国小初高中超时学习举报箱”\n用以揭露全国各地学校违规开学超时高压学习的行为。\n\n\n在中国，越来越多的学校实施所谓的「611学制」——早上6点上课，晚上11点放学。 这种近乎无休止的学习压力，将学生推入无法喘息的深渊。沉重的书包压弯的不只是嵴樑，还有本应灿烂的青春和自由呼吸的灵魂。\n\n知识本应点亮人生，而不是熄灭希望。\n教育本应培养思考，而不是消磨意志。\n教育的真谛不该是竞争至上，更不该以牺牲孩子的身心健康为代价。\n\n此表单基于 Google Form 匿名填写，无需登录，且不会记录任何个人信息。 但仍请谨慎保护自己的隐私。\n\n让我们一起，为被压迫在「611」制度下的学生发声。\n\n所有数据我们将在2月2日开始陆续公布。",
