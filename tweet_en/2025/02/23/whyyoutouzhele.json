    "content": "Media person Xiang Dongliang: Recently, many platforms have successively issued announcements that they will gradually pay social security for food delivery riders. However, Meituan is expected to have 820,000 full-time and stable riders. If the five insurances and one housing fund are paid according to the minimum base, 15.5 billion yuan will be spent each year, while Meituan's net profit in 2023 is more than 13.8 billion yuan. Therefore, it is impossible for the platform to fully bear the social security costs of the riders. The platform will only take the lead in opening social security accounts for the riders and deduct funds on their behalf every month.\nJD's so-called promise to buy insurance for riders refers to the purchase of social security for the new full-time food delivery riders, and the scale of this group of riders is expected to be around 10,000, accounting for less than 1% of all JD riders, and even less than a fraction of the number of riders that Meituan promised to buy social security.",
