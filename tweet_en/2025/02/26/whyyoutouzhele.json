    "content": "Recently, a man in South Korea imitated Chun Doo-hwan, who suppressed citizens during the 5.18 Gwangju Democratization Movement, sparking controversy. The man wore a jacket and military boots, cosplaying as Chun Doo-hwan, waving a red stick in front of the National Gwangju Museum. The video was captioned: \"Gwangju, I, Chun Doo-hwan, am back in the heavy snow!\" Park Kang-bae, executive director of the 5.18 Memorial Foundation, said: \"This is tearing up the painful history of our country. If you respect the history and citizens of other countries, you will never do this.\" He also said: \"Isn't this like people from our country going to China and holding a photo of President Xi Jinping to talk about the Tiananmen Incident? Please don't make fun of our pain.\" Earlier, in the football match between South Korea's Gwangju FC and China's Taishan, Chinese fans were photographed holding photos of Chun Doo-hwan and Kim Jong-un, which was criticized by the public.",
