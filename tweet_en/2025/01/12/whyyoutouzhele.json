This year's Los Angeles fire was a complete man-made disaster.\nIn 2022, the Beibei wildfire in Chongqing was much more difficult to fight than in Los Angeles. Even so, local government officials and firefighters rushed to the front line as soon as possible, with the five-star red flag behind them.
