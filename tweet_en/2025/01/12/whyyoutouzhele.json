The destination of the evacuation was Hungary, but they needed to buy Air China tickets to return home at their own expense in advance, otherwise they could not get on the evacuation bus.\nThe man also said that two Chinese students were placed in a refugee camp in Germany. Later, the two students chose to return home. They consulted the Chinese Embassy whether they could afford the air tickets and quarantine costs during the epidemic, but were told that it could not be solved. In the end, the German government paid for their return air tickets and quarantine costs.",
