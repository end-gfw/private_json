    "content": "January 28, Yunnan. A man posted a video saying that he sold a watch, but was told that the money he received was fraudulent funds, which caused his bank card, WeChat and Alipay to be frozen and unusable. He called and sent messages to the police many times, but received no response.\nThe man said that in order to prove his innocence, he wanted the buyer to come to the police station to make a statement, but the police said that as long as he could prove that he was just selling the watch, there was no need to ask the buyer to come to make a statement.\nLater, the police said that the watch was lost and might have flowed out of the country. They asked him if he was willing to return the fraudulent funds. The man refused and questioned the police's perfunctory attitude and failed his expectations.",
