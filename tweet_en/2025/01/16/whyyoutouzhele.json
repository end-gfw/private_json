In order to defraud national medical subsidies, Huangshi Mental Hospital forged signatures and medical records and illegally detained normal people.\nThe \"Hospitalization Statement\" released by the woman showed that after Liu Qingxiang was discharged from the hospital, she petitioned online and sent complaint letters every day. The government department had no choice but to forcibly send her to the hospital. After being admitted to the hospital, she waited for her family to give further consent and information. She did not receive any treatment during her stay in the hospital. At around 16:00, government staff and her family took her out of the hospital. \"",

    "content": "Bloomberg reports that economists predict that China is expected to experience the longest deflation since the Mao Zedong era. \nAccording to most economists' forecasts, deflation will continue for the second consecutive year in 2024, and official data is expected to be released on Friday. Some major Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, predict that deflation may continue until 2025. This situation has not been seen since the end of Mao Zedong's \"Great Leap Forward\" movement. \nAlthough China's actual economic growth rate is expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter of 2024, the gross domestic product deflator, the most commonly used indicator of price changes in an economy, is expected to reach -0.2% in 2025, which is the median forecast of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The average value in the decade before the epidemic was 3.4%.",
