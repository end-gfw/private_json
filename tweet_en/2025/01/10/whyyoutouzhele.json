On December 22, CCTV reported that 66 counties had returned 2 billion yuan of arrears of subsidies through the original channels and punished 1,200 people. However, the low-standard ingredients that have been eaten by students and the nutrition that has not entered the mouths of students may never be compensated.",

Without additional fiscal support, the pensions serving 460 million workers will be in deficit for the first time in four years. For many, reform may be too late. While it is difficult to determine the exact number of people whose pensions have been interrupted, according to Bloomberg's calculations based on data compiled by the think tank Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, it is estimated that tens of millions of people have stopped paying.",
