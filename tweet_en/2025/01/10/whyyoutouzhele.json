    "content": "In July 24, the National Audit Office randomly checked more than 100 counties, and more than 41% of the counties had misappropriated more than 2 billion yuan of rural student nutrition meal subsidies by lowering meal standards and purchasing low-quality food, which was used to compensate debts and distribute welfare. On December 22, CCTV reported that 66 counties had returned 2 billion yuan of arrears of subsidies through the original channels and punished 1,200 people. However, the low-standard ingredients that have been eaten by students and the nutrition that has not entered the mouths of students may never be compensated.",
