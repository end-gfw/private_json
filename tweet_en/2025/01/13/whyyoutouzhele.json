Does Solana allow DEXs on its network to discriminate against tokens for political reasons?\n\nContext: OKX, a crypto exchange with significant Chinese capital and close ties to the CCP, removed and banned $LI from its wallets just two days after launch, citing false pretenses. The real reason? $LI advocates for freedom of the press and speech—values the Chinese government considers a threat.\n\nMeanwhile, the $LI team has applied for verification on @JupiterExchange several times since its launch. Despite meeting all requirements, 25 days later, there’s still no approval.\n\nAs for @JupiterExchange, the $LI team applied for verification on the first day of its launch. Despite meeting all requirements, it has now been 25 days without approval.\n\nThis raises serious concerns. Is Solana’s largest DEX aggregator complicit in such political censorship?

The public security, procuratorial and judicial organs themselves are powerless to resist the evil forces.\nOn December 25 last year, Chen Jianxiong, a former judge of the Potou District People's Court of Zhanjiang City, was arrested by the police for \"credit card fraud\" for overdrawing his credit card by 14,000 yuan, and was later sentenced to 1 year and 1 month in prison.\nIt is reported that in 2006, when Chen Jianxiong was in charge of an execution case, he offended the then president Lu Moujin because he did not follow his illegal greeting.\nChen Jianxiong's defense lawyer Shen Yuan said: Bank card overdraft is a very normal thing, and Chen Jianxiong did not have the subjective intention to evade repayment. As a judge, he has a stable income and there is no need to evade a mere 10,000 yuan debt.",
