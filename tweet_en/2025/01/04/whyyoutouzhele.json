    "content": "January 3, Shanghai. The blogger interviewed a noodle shop owner, who said that the noodle shop had been open for ten years and had to close due to continuous losses.\nThe owner believed that the reason for the loss was that the shop mainly did lunch shifts, but there were fewer companies in the surrounding office buildings. The second reason was that consumption was downgraded, and many people felt that eating was enough.\nIn order to save the situation, the owner launched a set meal, but it still didn't help. She said that she was currently losing tens of thousands of yuan a month, and the performance of another noodle shop was also declining.",
