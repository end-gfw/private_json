    "content": "On December 26, lawyer Xiao Zhi'e said that her client Wang Zhongzhi was imprisoned for 12 years on trumped-up charges, and when he was released from prison at the age of 35, his wife and children had left him and his family had been destroyed.\nAfter that, Wang Zhongzhi appealed 2,465 times in 38 years, and finally got a not guilty verdict at the age of 73, but now he is 90 years old and has not received any compensation. The court believed that in 1957, when Wang Zhongzhi was in labor reform, the \"State Compensation Law\" had not yet been implemented, so no compensation would be given.",
