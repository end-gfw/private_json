    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday (January 17) rejected TikTok's appeal against the \"Sell or Ban\" bill, upholding Congress's ban on TikTok. This may result in 170 million users in the United States being unable to continue using TikTok after the 19th.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the law did not violate the right to free speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and that the U.S. government's national security concerns about Chinese companies that own TikTok were reasonable.\nThe court wrote in an unsigned opinion: \"There is no doubt that for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok provides a unique and extensive channel of expression, participation, and community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its national security concerns about TikTok's data collection and relationship with foreign adversaries.\"",

    "content": "Recently, the blogger \"老变态了了了\" of Bilibili exposed that Ni Yuancheng, an employee of Bilibili, loaded malicious code in the entire Bilibili webpage to attack specific netizens. After clicking on any video, the page of the attacked netizens will be replaced with a blank page and a prompt will pop up saying \"your account has been banned\".\nIt is currently speculated that Ni Yuancheng and other Bilibili netizens had a quarrel on the site and felt resentful, so he used his authority to load this malicious code.\nIn addition, Ni Yuancheng also threatened to block the netizen's account. Bilibili customer service: Please confirm the facts, a special investigation team will be set up, and the matter will be reported to the regulatory authorities.\nOn January 18, \"老变态了了了\" stated that there is no progress in the incident, and the explosive video will not be pushed and cannot be found.",
