    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday (January 17) rejected TikTok's appeal against the \"Sell or Ban\" bill, upholding Congress's ban on TikTok. This may result in 170 million users in the United States being unable to continue using TikTok after the 19th.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the law did not violate the right to free speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and that the U.S. government's national security concerns about Chinese companies that own TikTok were reasonable.\nThe court wrote in an unsigned opinion: \"There is no doubt that for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok provides a unique and extensive channel of expression, participation, and community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its national security concerns about TikTok's data collection and relationship with foreign adversaries.\"",
