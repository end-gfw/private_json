However, recently, a netizen decoded a yellow push WeChat QR code he received and found that the QR code actually led to the Gansu Provincial Government Department website (Figure 1).\nAfter that, we sorted out the yellow push QR codes in the private messages and found that there were two fake yellow push WeChat QR codes that led to the Jiaxing Federation of Trade Unions and Huzhou government department websites respectively. After using WeChat to scan, it will jump from the government website to a website with the address \"zns.china-yd.com\".\nAt present, we cannot determine whether this phenomenon is a hacker using a loophole in the government website to collect users' WeChat personal information.\nNetizens are welcome to use the QR code decoder to check the WeChat QR code received in their private messages and submit their contributions",
