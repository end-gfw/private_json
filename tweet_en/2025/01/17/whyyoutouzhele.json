    "content": "Due to two recent dog bites in Xi'an, the local authorities launched a vigorous dog-catching operation and required dog owners to apply for dog licenses, with a price of 500 yuan per dog in key restricted areas and 200 yuan per dog in general restricted areas. At the same time, large dogs are prohibited within the Third Ring Road, including dogs with an adult shoulder height greater than 50 cm. If found, each dog may be fined more than 200 yuan.\nAccording to many local netizens, in addition to forcibly catching outdoor dogs, the property management and police also teamed up to catch dogs at home, and even dogs in pet stores were loaded and taken away. Citizens were dissatisfied with the local one-size-fits-all approach. Some citizens posted the incident on the Internet platform and then received a call from the police asking them to delete the video.",
