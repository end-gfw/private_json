The experiment involved a well-known drug, enteric-coated aspirin tablets. Since the brand of enteric-coated aspirin tablets used in the experiment was changed two years ago, the experimental results have been visible to the naked eye.\nAccording to him, the enteric-coated aspirin tablets detection experiment is a required experiment in the second-year chemistry class. The purpose is to detect the carboxyl and ester groups in acetylsalicylic acid, the active ingredient of aspirin. In the ester group test, acetylsalicylic acid needs to be hydrolyzed first, and salicylic acid will be produced after hydrolysis. When salicylic acid encounters ferric chloride, a color change reaction occurs, and the solution appears purple.\nNow, since the solution changes color before and after the hydrolysis experiment, this link has lost its meaning, and the above phenomenon is common, and the results of student operations and teacher operations are consistent.",
