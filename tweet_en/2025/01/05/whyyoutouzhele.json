For example, some companies signed a contract with the government to invest in the local area, but suddenly the government wants to break the contract and terminate the contract in advance. In order not to bear the liability for breach of contract, the government will send people to inspect your company every now and then. As long as the problem is found, the debt can be converted into a criminal debt, and a fortune can be made. Even if the government terminates the contract in advance, it will be very difficult for the company to defend its rights and sue on the government's territory later.",
