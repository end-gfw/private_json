Recently, netizens discovered that he had suddenly closed his channel, and his online trace could not be found on domestic social platforms, as if he had disappeared from the world.\n It is reported that before Yan Dalu disappeared, he waved the blue sky and white sun flag in his last video, congratulated the Republic of China on its 113th birthday, and expressed his agreement with Lai Qingde’s theory of motherland during the Double Ten celebration. There is speculation that Yan Dalu’s disappearance may be related to this. .\n Yan Dalu said in the video, \"The Chinese Communist regime is the counter-institution that created the Republic of China.\" \"The Republic of China deserves to be the big brother of the People's Republic of China.\"",
