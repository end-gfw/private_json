    "content": "Following the announcement by the University of Macau on its official website that starting from the 2025/2026 school year, non-college entrance examination candidates from the mainland will no longer be eligible to apply for the university's undergraduate courses, four Macau universities including the Macau University of Science and Technology and the Macau Polytechnic University have recently followed suit and announced that they will no longer enroll non-college entrance examination candidates from the mainland in the 2025/2026 school year. Mainland students will no longer be able to apply to these five universities in Macau through international curriculum system scores such as A-Level/AP/IB. Industry insiders analyzed that the adjustment of policies by several universities in Macau may be related to the frequent academic fraud incidents in Hong Kong and Macau in recent years. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the Macau University of Science and Technology earlier discovered that 24 mainland students used forged DSE scores to enroll. After verification, the school made decisions such as revoking their student status and reporting to the police.",
