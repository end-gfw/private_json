He could get two to three thousand yuan for each illegal truck he let go, and received bribes of 1.654 million yuan in 4 years. Every Friday, many car agents lined up outside his office to give money. If the money was not in place, they would be constantly harassed. Zhang Guotao, a former auxiliary police officer at the Vehicle Administration Office, received WeChat red envelopes ranging from ten to dozens of yuan for a file, and the total amount over the years was as high as more than 470,000 yuan.",
