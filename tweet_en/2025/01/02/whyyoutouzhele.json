In the end, the police held him up and finished setting off the fireworks.\nAccording to the answer of Baidu AI, the public security organs shall order the cessation of the illegal setting off of fireworks and impose a fine of less than 500 yuan. The Public Security Administration Punishment Law does not give the police the right to take compulsory measures for setting off fireworks. Forcibly carrying away people who set off fireworks is suspected of excessive law enforcement.",
