A large number of depositors called the Qinyang Court of Henan to attend the trial, but the court's criminal court/court office/inspection phone number could not be reached. Many depositors believed that in order to avoid being held accountable for the wrongful case and apply for state compensation, Henan Public Security, Procuratorate and Court had to resort to this desperate measure. Ouyang Yun has been detained in Zhengzhou No. 3 Detention Center for almost a year. He has lost nearly 40 kilograms and is on the verge of mental collapse.",

The old man said that his wife had passed away 30 years ago and his only son also passed away 10 years ago. He could sell bottles for about 3 yuan every day. He was reluctant to eat meat and only ate a little bit during the Chinese New Year. A kind man bought some meat and fruit for the old grandfather.",
