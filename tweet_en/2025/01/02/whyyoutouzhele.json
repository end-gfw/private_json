Family members said: Ouyang Yun must have been forced to dismiss his lawyer's defense agency due to coercion, intimidation and inducement by the Henan authorities. A large number of depositors called the Qinyang Court of Henan to attend the trial, but the court's criminal court/court office/inspection phone number could not be reached. Many depositors believed that in order to avoid being held accountable for the wrongful case and apply for state compensation, Henan Public Security, Procuratorate and Court had to resort to this desperate measure. Ouyang Yun has been detained in Zhengzhou No. 3 Detention Center for almost a year. He has lost nearly 40 kilograms and is on the verge of mental collapse.",
