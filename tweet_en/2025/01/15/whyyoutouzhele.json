Recently, a North Korean soldier shouted \"General Kim Jong-un\" and tried to commit suicide with a grenade when facing Ukrainian prisoners, but was shot dead.\nThe total number of casualties of North Korean soldiers sent by North Korea to fight in the Kursk region of Russia exceeded 3,000, including more than 300 deaths and more than 2,700 injuries.\nThe Ukrainian intelligence department cooperated with the National Intelligence Service to obtain statements from two captured soldiers. According to the confession, the North Korean authorities promised to pay wages and give \"hero treatment\", but the actual situation did not match the promise, and the soldiers were actually treated as \"consumables\"",
