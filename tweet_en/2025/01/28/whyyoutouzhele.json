    "content": "The mother was scolded by the police at the police station because she did not do nucleic acid test in time due to illness. After her son interrupted, he was dragged into the women's restroom by the police and beaten.\nThe latest development of the case: The three police officers involved in the case were tried publicly. In court, the three people repeatedly testified and shirked each other. The prosecutor: It is recommended that the three be sentenced to 9 months in prison and suspended sentences.\nBefore the trial, Mr. Sun obtained 188,000 yuan in compensation from the defendant through civil litigation. \"This part of the compensation is based on facts, but I can't ask me to issue a letter of understanding and let them go to work normally as if nothing happened. I think they should be punished for their actions.\"",
