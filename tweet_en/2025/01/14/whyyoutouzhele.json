In the note, he said that he had never felt the love of his family since he was a child, no one cared when he was sick, and his parents forced him to repeat his senior year in high school. When he was in college, he interned in an electronics factory, worked until midnight without overtime pay, and was fired by his boss because of complaints.\nHe said that he had no way out, he could not graduate because he did not have enough credits, and all the suffering he had endured in his life was for a graduation certificate. \"I also want to rent a car and find out the time when my enemy's children get out of school, but if there is no hell, everything is empty after death, what is the point of revenge, if there is hell, wouldn't it be better to do good?\"",
